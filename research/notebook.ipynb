Some of these structures are very small and can\\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\\nmolecules in the body.\\nFIGURE 1.2 Gross and Microscopic Anatomy (a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain. (b) Microscopic anatomy\\ncan deal with the same structures, though at a different scale. This is a micrograph of nerve cells from the brain. LM × 1600. (credit a:\\n“WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\\nAnatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional\\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\\n8 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

For example, neurophysiology\\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\\nalong nerves).\\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.\\nFortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you\\nappreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that\\nallows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.\\n1.2 Structural Organization of the Human Body\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the structure of the human body in terms of six levels of organization\\n• List the eleven organ systems of the human body and identify at least one organ and one major function of each\\nBefore you begin to study the different structures and functions of the human body, it is helpful to consider its basic\\narchitecture; that is, how its smallest parts are assembled into larger structures. It is convenient to consider the\\nstructures of the body in terms of fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: subatomic\\nparticles, atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms and biosphere (Figure 1.3).\\n1.2 • Structural Organization of the Human Body 9'),\n",

All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances\\ncalled elements, familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest\\nunit of any of these pure substances (elements) is an atom. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles such as the\\nproton, electron and neutron. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules,\\nproteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.\\nA cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism.

These\\ncompartments keep body cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells moist and\\nnourished. They also separate internal body fluids from the countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces,\\nincluding the lining of certain passageways that connect to the outer surface of the body. The intestinal tract, for\\nexample, is home to more bacterial cells than the total of all human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside\\nthe body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.\\nCells, for example, have a cell membrane (also referred to as the plasma membrane) that keeps the intracellular\\nenvironment—the fluids and organelles—separate from the extracellular environment. Blood vessels keep blood\\ninside a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate\\nthem from surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal membranes keep major organs\\nsuch as the lungs, heart, and kidneys separate from others.\\nThe body’s largest organ system is the integumentary system, which includes the skin and its associated structures,\\nsuch as hair and nails. The surface tissue of skin is a barrier that protects internal structures and fluids from\\npotentially harmful microorganisms and other toxins.\\nMetabolism\\nThe first law of thermodynamics holds that energy can neither be created nor destroyed—it can only change form.\\nYour basic function as an organism is to consume (ingest) energy and molecules in the foods you eat, convert some\\nof it into fuel for movement, sustain your body functions, and build and maintain your body structures. There are two\\ntypes of reactions that accomplish this: anabolism and catabolism.\\n• Anabolism is the process whereby smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex\\nsubstances. Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex chemicals it needs by combining small\\nmolecules derived from the foods you eat\\n• Catabolism is the process by which larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller simpler\\nmolecules. Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in foods are broken down so the body\\ncan use their parts to assemble the structures and substances needed for life.\\nTaken together, these two processes are called metabolism. Metabolism is the sum of all anabolic and catabolic\\nreactions that take place in the body (Figure 1.6). Both anabolism and catabolism occur simultaneously and\\ncontinuously to keep you alive.\\n14 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Metabolism includes both anabolic and catabolic reactions.\\nEvery cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to store and release\\nenergy. The cell stores energy in the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the location\\nwhere energy is needed to fuel cellular activities. Then the ATP is broken down (catabolism) and a controlled\\namount of energy is released, which is used by the cell to perform a particular job.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nView this animation (http://openstax.org/l/metabolic) to learn more about metabolic processes.

Changes in an organism’s internal environment, such as increased body temperature, can\\ncause the responses of sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature,\\nas shown by the runners in Figure 1.7.\\nMovement\\nHuman movement includes not only actions at the joints of the body, but also the motion of individual organs and\\neven individual cells. As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your body, muscle\\ncells are contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture and to focus your vision, and glands are secreting\\nchemicals to regulate body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire muscle groups to enable you to\\nmove air into and out of your lungs, to push blood throughout your body, and to propel the food you have eaten\\nthrough your digestive tract. Consciously, of course, you contract your skeletal muscles to move the bones of your\\nskeleton to get from one place to another (as the runners are doing in Figure 1.7), and to carry out all of the activities\\nof your daily life.\\n1.3 • Functions of Human Life 15'),\n",

Earth and its atmosphere have\\nprovided us with air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, but these are not the only requirements for survival.\\nAlthough you may rarely think about it, you also cannot live outside of a certain range of temperature and pressure\\nthat the surface of our planet and its atmosphere provides. The next sections explore these four requirements of\\nlife.\\nOxygen\\nAtmospheric air is only about 20 percent oxygen, but that oxygen is a key component of the chemical reactions that\\nkeep the body alive, including the reactions that produce ATP. Brain cells are especially sensitive to lack of oxygen\\nbecause of their requirement for a high-and-steady production of ATP. Brain damage is likely within five minutes\\nwithout oxygen, and death is likely within ten minutes.\\n16 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The three basic classes of\\nnutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and\\nminerals).\\nThe most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be\\nable to survive for only a few days without water. The body’s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in\\nwater, and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells,\\nblood, and the fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult’s body mass. Water also helps\\nregulate our internal temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.\\nThe energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids\\nthat are the building blocks of the body itself. You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the\\ndigestive system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of\\ncarbohydrates and lipids can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might\\nfeel as if you are starving after missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding\\nnutrients for at least several weeks.\\nWater and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in\\nlarge amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\\nday or two.\\nNarrow Range of Temperature\\nYou have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold.\\nSuch deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a\\nnarrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well\\nabove or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal\\nstructure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.\\nThat said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s\\nresponses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the\\nbody, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so\\nadequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat\\nresponse is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the\\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life 17'),\n",

(credit: McKay Savage/flickr)\\nThe body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is\\nrandom muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\\ngenerate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop\\nsignificantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of\\nATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death.\\nThe body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent\\nblood from cooling there and so that the body’s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains\\nstable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood\\nflow to the extremities has been much reduced. This form of tissue damage can be permanent and lead to gangrene,\\nrequiring amputation of the affected region.\\nEveryday Connection\\nControlled Hypothermia\\nAs you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable\\ntemperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is\\nthe clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = “below” or “under”). Controlled hypothermia\\nis clinically induced hypothermia performed in order to reduce the metabolic rate of an organ or of a person’s\\nentire body.\\nControlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the\\nmetabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled\\nhypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to\\n25–32°C (79–89°F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient’s\\nbody. The heart is cooled further and is maintained at a temperature below 15°C (60°F) for the duration of the\\nsurgery. This very cold temperature helps the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the\\nsurgery.\\nSome emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients\\nwho have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the\\npatient’s body temperature to approximately 91 degrees. This condition, which is maintained for 24 hours,\\nslows the patient’s metabolic rate. Because the patient’s organs require less blood to function, the heart’s\\nworkload is reduced.\\n18 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='Narrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure\\nPressure is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is\\npressure exerted by the mixture of gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) in the Earth’s atmosphere. Although you\\nmay not perceive it, atmospheric pressure is constantly pressing down on your body. This pressure keeps gases\\nwithin your body, such as the gaseous nitrogen in body fluids, dissolved. If you were suddenly ejected from a space\\nship above Earth’s atmosphere, you would go from a situation of normal pressure to one of very low pressure. The\\npressure of the nitrogen gas in your blood would be much higher than the pressure of nitrogen in the space\\nsurrounding your body. As a result, the nitrogen gas in your blood would expand, forming bubbles that could block\\nblood vessels and even cause cells to break apart.\\nAtmospheric pressure does more than just keep blood gases dissolved. Your ability to breathe—that is, to take in\\noxygen and release carbon dioxide—also depends upon a precise atmospheric pressure. Altitude sickness occurs in\\npart because the atmosphere at high altitudes exerts less pressure, reducing the exchange of these gases, and\\ncausing shortness of breath, confusion, headache, lethargy, and nausea. Mountain climbers carry oxygen to reduce\\nthe effects of both low oxygen levels and low barometric pressure at higher altitudes (Figure 1.9).\\nFIGURE 1.9 Harsh Conditions Climbers on Mount Everest must accommodate extreme cold, low oxygen levels, and low barometric\\npressure in an environment hostile to human life. (credit: Melanie Ko/flickr)\\nHOME OSTATIC IMB ALANCE S\\nDecompression Sickness\\nDecompression sickness (DCS) is a condition in which gases dissolved in the blood or in other body tissues are no\\nlonger dissolved following a reduction in pressure on the body. This condition affects underwater divers who surface\\nfrom a deep dive too quickly, and it can affect pilots flying at high altitudes in planes with unpressurized cabins.\\nDivers often call this condition “the bends,” a reference to joint pain that is a symptom of DCS.\\nIn all cases, DCS is brought about by a reduction in barometric pressure. At high altitude, barometric pressure is\\nmuch less than on Earth’s surface because pressure is produced by the weight of the column of air above the body\\npressing down on the body. The very great pressures on divers in deep water are likewise from the weight of a\\ncolumn of water pressing down on the body. For divers, DCS occurs at normal barometric pressure (at sea level), but\\nit is brought on by the relatively rapid decrease of pressure as divers rise from the high pressure conditions of deep\\nwater to the now low, by comparison, pressure at sea level. Not surprisingly, diving in deep mountain lakes, where\\nbarometric pressure at the surface of the lake is less than that at sea level is more likely to result in DCS than diving\\nin water at sea level.\\nIn DCS, gases dissolved in the blood (primarily nitrogen) come rapidly out of solution, forming bubbles in the blood\\nand in other body tissues. This occurs because when pressure of a gas over a liquid is decreased, the amount of gas\\nthat can remain dissolved in the liquid also is decreased. It is air pressure that keeps your normal blood gases\\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life 19'),\n",

When pressure is reduced, less gas remains dissolved. You have seen this in effect when you\\nopen a carbonated drink. Removing the seal of the bottle reduces the pressure of the gas over the liquid. This in turn\\ncauses bubbles as dissolved gases (in this case, carbon dioxide) come out of solution in the liquid.\\nThe most common symptoms of DCS are pain in the joints, with headache and disturbances of vision occurring in 10\\npercent to 15 percent of cases. Left untreated, very severe DCS can result in death. Immediate treatment is with\\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\\n1.5 Homeostasis\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\\n• Contrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\\nNegative Feedback\\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a\\ncomponent of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center.\\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\\n20 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

(a) A negative feedback system has five basic parts. (b) Body temperature is\\nregulated by negative feedback.\\nIn order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that\\nis, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose,\\nspecific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic\\nbeta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream.\\nThe insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\\ngain (Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that\\nthe body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss\\ncenter.” This stimulation has three major effects:\\n• Blood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the\\nskin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.\\n• As blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat\\nevaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.\\n• The depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the\\nnasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.\\nIn contrast, activation of the brain’s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood\\nreturning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body\\ncore and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal\\nmuscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while\\nusing up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\\nheat production.\\n1.5 • Homeostasis 21'),\n",

Which organ has primary control over the amount of water in the body?\\nPositive Feedback\\nPositive feedback intensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation\\nfrom the normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive\\nfeedback in the body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body’s response to blood\\nloss are two examples of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed.\\nChildbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired.\\nEnormous changes in a person’s body are required to expel the baby at the end of pregnancy. And the events of\\nchildbirth, once begun, must progress rapidly to a conclusion or the life of a person giving bith and the baby are at\\nrisk. The extreme muscular work of labor and delivery are the result of a positive feedback system (Figure 1.11).\\nFIGURE 1.11 Positive Feedback Loop Normal childbirth is driven by a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop results in a\\nchange in the body’s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.\\nThe first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The\\ncervix contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells\\nsend messages to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone\\noxytocin into the bloodstream. Oxytocin causes stronger contractions of the smooth muscles in of the uterus (the\\neffectors), pushing the baby further down the birth canal. This causes even greater stretching of the cervix. The\\ncycle of stretching, oxytocin release, and increasingly more forceful contractions stops only when the baby is born.\\nAt this point, the stretching of the cervix halts, stopping the release of oxytocin.\\nA second example of positive feedback centers on reversing extreme damage to the body. Following a penetrating\\nwound, the most immediate threat is excessive blood loss. Less blood circulating means reduced blood pressure\\nand reduced perfusion (penetration of blood) to the brain and other vital organs. If perfusion is severely reduced,\\nvital organs will shut down and the person will die.

However, the\\npurpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example,\\nis a scar “above the wrist” located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the\\nhand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity.\\nAnatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in\\neveryday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.\\nAnatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or\\ncondition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix\\n“hyper-” means “high” or “over,” and the root word “tension” refers to pressure, so the word “hypertension” refers\\nto abnormally high blood pressure.\\nAnatomical Position\\nTo further increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body. Just as maps are\\nnormally oriented with north at the top, the standard body “map,” or anatomical position, is that of the body\\nstanding upright, with the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each\\nside, and the palms of the hands face forward as illustrated in Figure 1.12. Using this standard position reduces\\nconfusion. It does not matter how the body being described is oriented, the terms are used as if it is in anatomical\\nposition. For example, a scar in the “anterior (front) carpal (wrist) region” would be present on the palm side of the\\nwrist. The term “anterior” would be used even if the hand were palm down on a table.\\n1.6 • Anatomical Terminology 23'),\n",

Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities\\nthat house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral\\ncolumn and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord\\nwithin the posterior (dorsal) cavity.\\nThe anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see\\nFigure 1.15). The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib\\ncage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum.

Between the parietal and\\nvisceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity (Figure 1.17).\\n1.6 • Anatomical Terminology 27'),\n",

An inability to control bleeding, infection, and pain made surgeries\\ninfrequent, and those that were performed—such as wound suturing, amputations, tooth and tumor removals, skull\\ndrilling, and cesarean births—did not greatly advance knowledge about internal anatomy. Theories about the\\nfunction of the body and about disease were therefore largely based on external observations and imagination.\\nDuring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however, the detailed anatomical drawings of Italian artist and\\nanatomist Leonardo da Vinci and Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius were published, and interest in human\\nanatomy began to increase. Medical schools began to teach anatomy using human dissection; although some\\nresorted to grave robbing to obtain corpses. Laws were eventually passed that enabled students to dissect the\\ncorpses of criminals and those who donated their bodies for research. Still, it was not until the late nineteenth\\ncentury that medical researchers discovered non-surgical methods to look inside the living body.\\nX-Rays\\nGerman physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (1845–1923) was experimenting with electrical current when he discovered that\\na mysterious and invisible “ray” would pass through his flesh but leave an outline of his bones on a screen coated\\nwith a metal compound. In 1895, Röntgen made the first durable record of the internal parts of a living human: an\\n“X-ray” image (as it came to be called) of his wife’s hand. Scientists around the world quickly began their own\\nexperiments with X-rays, and by 1900, X-rays were widely used to detect a variety of injuries and diseases. In 1901,\\nRöntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize for physics for his work in this field.\\nThe X-ray is a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation with a short wavelength capable of penetrating solids\\n28 1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

As they are used in medicine, X-rays are emitted from an X-ray machine and directed toward a\\nspecially treated metallic plate placed behind the patient’s body. The beam of radiation results in darkening of the\\nX-ray plate. X-rays are slightly impeded by soft tissues, which show up as gray on the X-ray plate, whereas hard\\ntissues, such as bone, largely block the rays, producing a light-toned “shadow.” Thus, X-rays are best used to\\nvisualize hard body structures such as teeth and bones (Figure 1.18). Like many forms of high energy radiation,\\nhowever, X-rays are capable of damaging cells and initiating changes that can lead to cancer. This danger of\\nexcessive exposure to X-rays was not fully appreciated for many years after their widespread use.\\nFIGURE 1.18 X-Ray of a Hand High energy electromagnetic radiation allows the internal structures of the body, such as bones, to be\\nseen in X-rays like these. (credit: Trace Meek/flickr)\\nRefinements and enhancements of X-ray techniques have continued throughout the twentieth and twenty-first\\ncenturies. Although often supplanted by more sophisticated imaging techniques, the X-ray remains a “workhorse” in\\nmedical imaging, especially for viewing fractures and for dentistry. The disadvantage of irradiation to the patient and\\nthe operator is now attenuated by proper shielding and by limiting exposure.\\nModern Medical Imaging\\nX-rays can depict a two-dimensional image of a body region, and only from a single angle. In contrast, more recent\\nmedical imaging technologies produce data that is integrated and analyzed by computers to produce three-\\ndimensional images or images that reveal aspects of body functioning.\\nComputed Tomography\\nTomography refers to imaging by sections. Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that\\nuses computers to analyze several cross-sectional X-rays in order to reveal minute details about structures in the\\nbody (Figure 1.19a). The technique was invented in the 1970s and is based on the principle that, as X-rays pass\\nthrough the body, they are absorbed or reflected at different levels. In the technique, a patient lies on a motorized\\nplatform while a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner rotates 360 degrees around the patient, taking X-ray\\nimages. A computer combines these images into a two-dimensional view of the scanned area, or “slice.”\\n1.7 • Medical Imaging 29'),\n",

It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain\\nand the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the\\nsize of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of\\nradiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of\\ndeveloping cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nA CT or CAT scan relies on a circling scanner that revolves around the patient’s body. Watch this video\\n(http://openstax.org/l/CATscan) to learn more about CT and CAT scans. What type of radiation does a CT scanner\\nuse?\\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear\\nphysics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit\\nradio signals. In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous)\\ntissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device,\\nwhich was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital\\ncomputing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to\\ndiscover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.\\nDrawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI\\nscanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded.

The device is also so noisy that, even\\nwith earplugs, patients can become anxious or even fearful. These problems have been overcome somewhat with\\nthe development of “open” MRI scanning, which does not require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal\\ntube. Patients with iron-containing metallic implants (internal sutures, some prosthetic devices, and so on) cannot\\nundergo MRI scanning because it can dislodge these implants.\\nFunctional MRIs (fMRIs), which detect the concentration of blood flow in certain parts of the body, are increasingly\\nbeing used to study the activity in parts of the brain during various body activities. This has helped scientists learn\\nmore about the locations of different brain functions and more about brain abnormalities and diseases.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nA patient undergoing an MRI is surrounded by a tube-shaped scanner. Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/MRI)\\nto learn more about MRIs. What is the function of magnets in an MRI?\\nPositron Emission Tomography\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique involving the use of so-called\\nradiopharmaceuticals, substances that emit radiation that is short-lived and therefore relatively safe to administer\\nto the body. Although the first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before\\nradiopharmaceuticals were combined with the technique and revolutionized its potential. The main advantage is\\nthat PET (see Figure 1.19c) can illustrate physiologic activity—including nutrient metabolism and blood flow—of the\\norgan or organs being targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans can only show static images. PET is widely used to\\ndiagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain\\nabnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nPET relies on radioactive substances administered several minutes before the scan. Watch this video\\n(http://openstax.org/l/PET) to learn more about PET. How is PET used in chemotherapy?\\nUltrasonography\\nUltrasonography is an imaging technique that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body\\nto generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see\\nFigure 1.19d). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in\\nsensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s.\\nUltrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as\\ngallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the\\nimage quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.\\n1.7 • Medical Imaging 31'),\n",

In the past, anatomy has primarily been\\nstudied via observing injuries, and later by the\\ndissection of anatomical structures of cadavers, but in\\nthe past century, computer-assisted imaging\\ntechniques have allowed clinicians to look inside the\\nliving body. Human physiology is the scientific study of\\nthe chemistry and physics of the structures of the body.\\nPhysiology explains how the structures of the body\\nwork together to maintain life. It is difficult to study\\nstructure (anatomy) without knowledge of function\\n(physiology). The two disciplines are typically studied\\ntogether because form and function are closely related\\nin all living things.\\n1.2 Structural Organization of the Human\\nBody\\nLife processes of the human body are maintained at\\nseveral levels of structural organization. These include\\nthe chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and\\nthe organism level. Higher levels of organization are\\nbuilt from lower levels. Therefore, molecules combine\\nto form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues\\ncombine to form organs, organs combine to form organ\\nsystems, and organ systems combine to form\\norganisms.\\n1.3 Functions of Human Life\\nMost processes that occur in the human body are not\\n1 • Chapter Review 33'),\n",

They occur continuously to\\nbuild, maintain, and sustain life. These processes\\ninclude: organization, in terms of the maintenance of\\nessential body boundaries; metabolism, including\\nenergy transfer via anabolic and catabolic reactions;\\nresponsiveness; movement; and growth,\\ndifferentiation, reproduction, and renewal.\\n1.4 Requirements for Human Life\\nHumans cannot survive for more than a few minutes\\nwithout oxygen, for more than several days without\\nwater, and for more than several weeks without\\ncarbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.\\nAlthough the body can respond to high temperatures\\nby sweating and to low temperatures by shivering and\\nincreased fuel consumption, long-term exposure to\\nextreme heat and cold is not compatible with survival.\\nThe body requires a precise atmospheric pressure to\\nmaintain its gases in solution and to facilitate\\nrespiration—the intake of oxygen and the release of\\ncarbon dioxide. Humans also require blood pressure\\nhigh enough to ensure that blood reaches all body\\ntissues but low enough to avoid damage to blood\\nvessels.\\n1.5 Homeostasis\\nHomeostasis is the activity of cells throughout the body\\nto maintain the physiological state within a narrow\\nrange that is compatible with life. Homeostasis is\\nregulated by negative feedback loops and, much less\\nfrequently, by positive feedback loops. Both have the\\nsame components of a stimulus, sensor, control center,\\nand effector; however, negative feedback loops work to\\nprevent an excessive response to the stimulus,\\nwhereas positive feedback loops intensify the\\nresponse until an end point is reached.\\n1.6 Anatomical Terminology\\nAncient Greek and Latin words are used to build\\nanatomical terms. A standard reference position for\\nmapping the body’s structures is the normal\\nanatomical position. Regions of the body are identified\\nusing terms such as “occipital” that are more precise\\nthan common words and phrases such as “the back of\\nthe head.” Directional terms such as anterior and\\nposterior are essential for accurately describing the\\nrelative locations of body structures. Images of the\\nbody’s interior commonly align along one of three\\nplanes: the sagittal, frontal, or transverse. The body’s\\norgans are organized in one of two main\\ncavities—dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral\\n(also referred to anterior)—which are further sub-\\ndivided according to the structures present in each\\narea. The serous membranes have two layers—parietal\\nand visceral—surrounding a fluid filled space. Serous\\nmembranes cover the lungs (pleural serosa), heart\\n(pericardial serosa), and some abdominopelvic organs\\n(peritoneal serosa).\\n1.7 Medical Imaging\\nDetailed anatomical drawings of the human body first\\nbecame available in the fifteenth and sixteenth\\ncenturies; however, it was not until the end of the\\nnineteenth century, and the discovery of X-rays, that\\nanatomists and physicians discovered non-surgical\\nmethods to look inside a living body. Since then, many\\nother techniques, including CT scans, MRI scans, PET\\nscans, and ultrasonography, have been developed,\\nproviding more accurate and detailed views of the form\\nand function of the human body.\\nInteractive Link Questions\\n1.

Scientists define matter as anything\\nthat occupies space and has mass. An object’s mass and its weight are related concepts, but not quite the same. An\\nobject’s mass is the amount of matter contained in the object, and the object’s mass is the same whether that object\\nis on Earth or in the zero-gravity environment of outer space. An object’s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as\\naffected by the pull of gravity. Where gravity strongly pulls on an object’s mass its weight is greater than it is where\\ngravity is less strong. An object of a certain mass weighs less on the moon, for example, than it does on Earth\\nbecause the gravity of the moon is less than that of Earth. In other words, weight is variable, and is influenced by\\ngravity. A piece of cheese that weighs a pound on Earth weighs only a few ounces on the moon.\\nElements and Compounds\\nAll matter in the natural world is composed of one or more of the 92 fundamental substances called elements. An\\nelement is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or\\nbroken down by ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed\\nfor life from their constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar\\nexample of an element that you must take in is calcium (Ca). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed\\nand used for a number of processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your\\ndigestive system breaks down the food into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these\\nis calcium, which, because it is an element, cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese,\\ntherefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are\\noxygen, sodium, and iron. The elements in the human body are shown in Figure 2.2, beginning with the most\\nabundant: oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Each element’s name can be replaced by a one- or\\ntwo-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this course. All the elements in your body are\\nderived from the foods you eat and the air you breathe.\\nFIGURE 2.2 Elements of the Human Body The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant to least\\nabundant.\\n40 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Instead, they combine to form compounds. A compound is a substance\\ncomposed of two or more elements joined by chemical bonds. For example, the compound glucose is an important\\nbody fuel. It is always composed of the same three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Moreover, the\\nelements that make up any given compound always occur in the same relative amounts. In glucose, there are\\nalways six carbon and six oxygen units for every twelve hydrogen units. But what, exactly, are these “units” of\\nelements?\\nAtoms and Subatomic Particles\\nAn atom is the smallest quantity of an element that retains the unique properties of that element. In other words, an\\natom of hydrogen is a unit of hydrogen—the smallest amount of hydrogen that can exist. As you might guess, atoms\\nare almost unfathomably small. The period at the end of this sentence is millions of atoms wide.\\nAtomic Structure and Energy\\nAtoms are made up of even smaller subatomic particles, three types of which are important: the proton, neutron,\\nand electron. The number of positively-charged protons and non-charged (“neutral”) neutrons, gives mass to the\\natom, and the number of protons determines the element. The number of negatively-charged electrons that “spin”\\naround the nucleus at close to the speed of light equals the number of protons. An electron has about 1/2000th the\\nmass of a proton or neutron.\\nFigure 2.3 shows two models that can help you imagine the structure of an atom—in this case, helium (He). In the\\nplanetary model, helium’s two electrons are shown circling the nucleus in a fixed orbit depicted as a ring. Although\\nthis model is helpful in visualizing atomic structure, in reality, electrons do not travel in fixed orbits, but whiz around\\nthe nucleus erratically in a so-called electron cloud.\\nFIGURE 2.3 Two Models of Atomic Structure (a) In the planetary model, the electrons of helium are shown in fixed orbits, depicted as\\nrings, at a precise distance from the nucleus, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun.

Just as a magnet sticks to a steel refrigerator because their opposite charges attract, the positively charged\\nprotons attract the negatively charged electrons. This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The\\nattraction by the positively charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far. The number of protons and\\nelectrons within a neutral atom are equal, thus, the atom’s overall charge is balanced.\\nAtomic Number and Mass Number\\nAn atom of carbon is unique to carbon, but a proton of carbon is not. One proton is the same as another, whether it is\\nfound in an atom of carbon, sodium (Na), or iron (Fe). The same is true for neutrons and electrons. So, what gives an\\nelement its distinctive properties—what makes carbon so different from sodium or iron? The answer is the unique\\nquantity of protons each contains. Carbon by definition is an element whose atoms contain six protons. No other\\nelement has exactly six protons in its atoms. Moreover, all atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump\\nof coal, contain six protons. Thus, the atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom,\\nidentifies the element. Because an atom usually has the same number of electrons as protons, the atomic number\\nidentifies the usual number of electrons as well.\\nIn their most common form, many elements also contain the same number of neutrons as protons. The most\\ncommon form of carbon, for example, has six neutrons as well as six protons, for a total of 12 subatomic particles in\\nits nucleus. An element’s mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So the\\nmost common form of carbon’s mass number is 12. (Electrons have so little mass that they do not appreciably\\ncontribute to the mass of an atom.) Carbon is a relatively light element. Uranium (U), in contrast, has a mass number\\nof 238 and is referred to as a heavy metal. Its atomic number is 92 (it has 92 protons) but it contains 146 neutrons;\\nit has the most mass of all the naturally occurring elements.\\nThe periodic table of the elements, shown in Figure 2.4, is a chart identifying the 92 elements found in nature, as\\nwell as several larger, unstable elements discovered experimentally. The elements are arranged in order of their\\natomic number, with hydrogen and helium at the top of the table, and the more massive elements below. The\\nperiodic table is a useful device because for each element, it identifies the chemical symbol, the atomic number, and\\nthe mass number, while organizing elements according to their propensity to react with other elements. The number\\nof protons and electrons in an element are equal.

An isotope is one of the\\ndifferent forms of an element, distinguished from one another by different numbers of neutrons. The standard\\nisotope of carbon is 12C, commonly called carbon twelve. 12C has six protons and six neutrons, for a mass number of\\ntwelve.

The different isotopes of an element can also be indicated with the mass number hyphenated\\n(for example, C-12 instead of 12C).

Different radioactive\\nisotopes (also called radioisotopes) differ in their half-life, the time it takes for half of any size sample of an isotope\\nto decay.

Excessive exposure to radioactive isotopes can damage\\nhuman cells and even cause cancer and birth defects, but when exposure is controlled, some radioactive isotopes\\ncan be useful in medicine. For more information, see the Career Connections.\\nCAREER C ONNE CTION\\nInterventional Radiologist\\nThe controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional\\nradiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many\\nconditions that could once only be treated with a lengthy and traumatic operation can now be treated non-\\nsurgically, reducing the cost, pain, length of hospital stay, and recovery time for patients. For example, in the past,\\nthe only options for a patient with one or more tumors in the liver were surgery and chemotherapy (the\\nadministration of drugs to treat cancer). Some liver tumors, however, are difficult to access surgically, and others\\ncould require the surgeon to remove too much of the liver. Moreover, chemotherapy is highly toxic to the liver, and\\ncertain tumors do not respond well to it anyway. In some such cases, an interventional radiologist can treat the\\ntumors by disrupting their blood supply, which they need if they are to continue to grow. In this procedure, called\\nradioembolization, the radiologist accesses the liver with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient’s blood\\nvessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive “seeds” into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the\\ndays and weeks following the procedure, the radiation emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills\\nthe tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment.\\nRadioisotopes emit subatomic particles that can be detected and tracked by imaging technologies. One of the most\\nadvanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the\\nactivity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The\\nPET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the\\nmost metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some\\ncancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.\\n44 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Rather, they are constantly reacting with other\\natoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must\\ngrasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.\\nAlthough electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom’s nucleus, they do tend to stay\\nwithin certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the\\nnucleus at a distinct energy level.\\nThe atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells\\nhold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same\\nfor all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\\nand helium.\\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third\\nspills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with\\nits six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two\\nelectron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to\\nneon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These\\nelements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.\\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter 45'),\n",

(b) The electrons of carbon\\ncompletely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons,\\nfilling both of its electron shells.\\nThe factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\\nways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This\\nsingle electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single\\nvalence shell can be stabilized.\\nAll atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly\\neight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For\\nexample, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the\\naddition of two electrons to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each\\nshare their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H2O.\\nIn nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example,\\ncarbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements\\nform the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-\\ncontaining compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its\\nvalence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H2O. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen”\\nreflects its contribution to water (hydro- = “water”; -gen = “maker”). Thus, hydrogen is the “water maker.”\\n46 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

But do atoms ever actually touch one another? Most physicists would say no, because the\\nnegatively charged electrons in their valence shells repel one another. No force within the human body—or\\nanywhere in the natural world—is strong enough to overcome this electrical repulsion. So when you read about\\natoms linking together or colliding, bear in mind that the atoms are not merging in a physical sense.\\nInstead, atoms link by forming a chemical bond. A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\\nmethane, or CH4.\\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\\nIons and Ionic Bonds\\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\\ncharges. What happens to the charged electroscope when a conductor is moved between its plastic sheets, and\\nwhy?\\nPotassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells. Its atomic number is 19. It has just one\\nelectron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in\\nwhich it donates one electron. (It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The\\nloss will cause the positive charge of potassium’s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of\\npotassium’s electrons. In other words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is\\nwritten K+, indicating that it has lost a single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a cation.\\nNow consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in\\nits valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it\\nis easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber\\nits protons by one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is\\nwritten as F–.

This explains why “table\\nsalt,” for example, actually is a molecule called a “salt” in chemistry, which consists of equal numbers of positively-\\ncharged sodium (Na+) and negatively-charged chloride (Cl–), dissolves so readily in water, in this case forming\\ndipole-ion bonds between the water and the electrically-charged ions (electrolytes). Water molecules also repel\\nmolecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen\\nexperiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water.\\nInstead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the\\nnonpolar oil.\\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Distinguish between kinetic and potential energy, and between exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions\\n• Identify four forms of energy important in human functioning\\n• Describe the three basic types of chemical reactions\\n• Identify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions\\nOne characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go\\non to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic\\nchemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism\\ncan proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules\\nbreak, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of\\nenergy.\\nThe Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions\\nChemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and\\nforce that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy\\npowering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one\\nbrick atop another is kinetic energy—the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it\\nstores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is\\nneither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before\\nheading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged\\nby your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.\\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions 51'),\n",

The catabolism of the\\nfoods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules\\nyour body uses for fuel, but some of it is released—for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb\\nmore energy than they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule\\nstores not only the chemical energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction.\\nBecause energy is neither created nor destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come\\nfrom? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.\\nForms of Energy Important in Human Functioning\\nYou have already learned that chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released by chemical bonds. In addition to\\nchemical energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.\\n• Mechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly\\npowers the movement of matter. When you lift a brick into place on a wall, your muscles provide the mechanical\\nenergy that moves the brick.\\n• Radiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from\\nlong radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei. The full\\nspectrum of radiant energy is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. The body uses the ultraviolet energy\\nof sunlight to convert a compound in skin cells to vitamin D, which is essential to human functioning. The human\\neye evolved to see the wavelengths that comprise the colors of the rainbow, from red to violet, so that range in\\nthe spectrum is called “visible light.”\\n• Electrical energy, supplied by electrolytes in cells and body fluids, contributes to the voltage changes that help\\ntransmit impulses in nerve and muscle cells.\\nCharacteristics of Chemical Reactions\\nAll chemical reactions begin with a reactant, the general term for the one or more substances that enter into the\\nreaction. Sodium and chloride ions, for example, are the reactants in the production of table salt. The one or more\\nsubstances produced by a chemical reaction are called the product.\\nIn chemical reactions, the components of the reactants—the elements involved and the number of atoms of\\neach—are all present in the product(s). Similarly, there is nothing present in the products that are not present in the\\nreactants. This is because chemical reactions are governed by the law of conservation of mass, which states that\\nmatter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.\\nJust as you can express mathematical calculations in equations such as 2 + 7 = 9, you can use chemical equations\\nto show how reactants become products. As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of\\nan equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds. For\\nexample, the chemical reaction in which one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen produce ammonia would\\nbe written as . Correspondingly, the breakdown of ammonia into its components would be written\\nas\\nNotice that, in the first example, a nitrogen (N) atom and three hydrogen (H) atoms bond to form a compound. This\\nanabolic reaction requires energy, which is then stored within the compound’s bonds. Such reactions are referred to\\nas synthesis reactions. A synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that results in the synthesis (joining) of\\ncomponents that were formerly separate (Figure 2.12a). Again, nitrogen and hydrogen are reactants in a synthesis\\nreaction that yields ammonia as the product. The general equation for a synthesis reaction is\\n52 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Such reactions are referred to as decomposition reactions. A decomposition\\nreaction is a chemical reaction that breaks down or “de-composes” something larger into its constituent parts (see\\nFigure 2.12b). The general equation for a decomposition reaction is: .\\nAn exchange reaction is a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are\\nboth formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (see Figure 2.12c). The simplest\\nform of an exchange reaction might be: . Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to\\nbreak apart in a decomposition reaction, whereas A and B had to bond in a synthesis reaction. A more complex\\nexchange reaction might be: . Another example might be: .\\nIn theory, any chemical reaction can proceed in either direction under the right conditions. Reactants may\\nsynthesize into a product that is later decomposed. Reversibility is also a quality of exchange reactions. For instance,\\ncould then reverse to . This reversibility of a chemical reaction is indicated\\nwith a double arrow: . Still, in the human body, many chemical reactions do proceed in a\\npredictable direction, either one way or the other. You can think of this more predictable path as the path of least\\nresistance because, typically, the alternate direction requires more energy.\\nFactors Influencing the Rate of Chemical Reactions\\nIf you pour vinegar into baking soda, the reaction is instantaneous; the concoction will bubble and fizz. But many\\nchemical reactions take time. A variety of factors influence the rate of chemical reactions. This section, however, will\\nconsider only the most important in human functioning.\\nProperties of the Reactants\\nIf chemical reactions are to occur quickly, the atoms in the reactants have to have easy access to one another. Thus,\\nthe greater the surface area of the reactants, the more readily they will interact. When you pop a cube of cheese into\\nyour mouth, you chew it before you swallow it. Among other things, chewing increases the surface area of the food\\nso that digestive chemicals can more easily get at it. As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\\nspace between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions\\ninvolving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.\\nIn addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive\\nelements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving\\nstable elements like helium are not likely to happen at all.\\nTemperature\\nNearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of\\nmatter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy.\\nThe higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.\\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions 53'),\n",

But as more and more\\npeople get up to dance—especially if the music is fast—collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical\\nreactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one\\nanother. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the concentration of\\nparticles—the number of particles in the space—but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would\\ncorrespondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the\\nparty to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of\\ncollisions would increase accordingly.\\nEnzymes and Other Catalysts\\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\\nFIGURE 2.13 Enzymes Enzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.\\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Compare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds\\n• Identify the properties of water that make it essential to life\\n• Explain the role of salts in body functioning\\n• Distinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH\\n• Discuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis\\n54 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the\\ncompounds important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or\\norganic.\\n• An inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many\\ninorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl)\\nproduced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon\\ndioxide (CO2) is one of the few examples.\\n• An organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are\\nsynthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and\\nhydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two\\nelements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the\\nchemicals that fuel your functioning.\\nThe following section examines the three groups of inorganic compounds essential to life: water, salts, acids, and\\nbases. Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.\\nWater\\nAs much as 70 percent of an adult’s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between\\nthe cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.\\nWater as a Lubricant and Cushion\\nWater is a major component of many of the body’s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water\\nin synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil\\nwith breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of\\nadjacent abdominal organs is friction free.\\nWater also protects cells and organs from physical trauma, cushioning the brain within the skull, for example, and\\nprotecting the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes. Water cushions a developing fetus in the mother’s womb as well.\\nWater as a Heat Sink\\nA heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding\\nincrease in temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly\\nincreasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps\\nkeep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body’s core flows to the blood vessels just\\nunder the skin and is transferred to the environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat.\\nAs the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates\\nback to the body core.\\nWater as a Component of Liquid Mixtures\\nA mixture is a combination of two or more substances, each of which maintains its own chemical identity. In other\\nwords, the constituent substances are not chemically bonded into a new, larger chemical compound. The concept is\\neasy to imagine if you think of powdery substances such as flour and sugar; when you stir them together in a bowl,\\nthey obviously do not bond to form a new compound. The room air you breathe is a gaseous mixture, containing\\nthree discrete elements—nitrogen, oxygen, and argon—and one compound, carbon dioxide. There are three types of\\nliquid mixtures, all of which contain water as a key component. These are solutions, colloids, and suspensions.\\nFor cells in the body to survive, they must be kept moist in a water-based liquid called a solution. In chemistry, a\\nliquid solution consists of a solvent that dissolves a substance called a solute. An important characteristic of\\nsolutions is that they are homogeneous; that is, the solute molecules are distributed evenly throughout the solution.\\nIf you were to stir a teaspoon of sugar into a glass of water, the sugar would dissolve into sugar molecules separated\\nby water molecules. The ratio of sugar to water in the left side of the glass would be the same as the ratio of sugar to\\nwater in the right side of the glass. If you were to add more sugar, the ratio of sugar to water would change, but the\\ndistribution—provided you had stirred well—would still be even.\\nWater is considered the “universal solvent” and it is believed that life cannot exist without water because of this.\\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 55'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content='Water is certainly the most abundant solvent in the body; essentially all of the body’s chemical reactions occur\\namong compounds dissolved in water. Because water molecules are polar, with regions of positive and negative\\nelectrical charge, water readily dissolves ionic compounds and polar covalent compounds. Such compounds are\\nreferred to as hydrophilic, or “water-loving.” As mentioned above, sugar dissolves well in water. This is because\\nsugar molecules contain regions of hydrogen-oxygen polar bonds, making it hydrophilic. Nonpolar molecules, which\\ndo not readily dissolve in water, are called hydrophobic, or “water-fearing.”\\nConcentrations of Solutes\\nVarious mixtures of solutes and water are described in chemistry. The concentration of a given solute is the number\\nof particles of that solute in a given space (oxygen makes up about 21 percent of atmospheric air). In the\\nbloodstream of humans, glucose concentration is usually measured in milligram (mg) per deciliter (dL), and in a\\nhealthy adult averages about 100 mg/dL. Another method of measuring the concentration of a solute is by its\\nmolarity—which is moles (M) of the molecules per liter (L). The mole of an element is its atomic weight, while a mole\\nof a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of its components, called the molecular weight. An often-used\\nexample is calculating a mole of glucose, with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Using the periodic table, the atomic\\nweight of carbon (C) is 12.011 grams (g), and there are six carbons in glucose, for a total atomic weight of 72.066 g.\\nDoing the same calculations for hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), the molecular weight equals 180.156g (the “gram\\nmolecular weight” of glucose). When water is added to make one liter of solution, you have one mole (1M) of\\nglucose. This is particularly useful in chemistry because of the relationship of moles to “Avogadro’s number.” A mole\\nof any solution has the same number of particles in it: 6.02 × 1023. Many substances in the bloodstream and other\\ntissue of the body are measured in thousandths of a mole, or millimoles (mM).\\nA colloid is a mixture that is somewhat like a heavy solution. The solute particles consist of tiny clumps of molecules\\nlarge enough to make the liquid mixture opaque (because the particles are large enough to scatter light). Familiar\\nexamples of colloids are milk and cream. In the thyroid glands, the thyroid hormone is stored as a thick protein\\nmixture also called a colloid.\\nA suspension is a liquid mixture in which a heavier substance is suspended temporarily in a liquid, but over time,\\nsettles out. This separation of particles from a suspension is called sedimentation. An example of sedimentation\\noccurs in the blood test that establishes sedimentation rate, or sed rate. The test measures how quickly red blood\\ncells in a test tube settle out of the watery portion of blood (known as plasma) over a set period of time. Rapid\\nsedimentation of blood cells does not normally happen in the healthy body, but aspects of certain diseases can\\ncause blood cells to clump together, and these heavy clumps of blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube\\nmore quickly than do normal blood cells.\\nThe Role of Water in Chemical Reactions\\nTwo types of chemical reactions involve the creation or the consumption of water: dehydration synthesis and\\nhydrolysis.\\n• In dehydration synthesis, one reactant gives up an atom of hydrogen and another reactant gives up a hydroxyl\\ngroup (OH) in the synthesis of a new product. In the formation of their covalent bond, a molecule of water is\\nreleased as a byproduct (Figure 2.14). This is also sometimes referred to as a condensation reaction.\\n• In hydrolysis, a molecule of water disrupts a compound, breaking its bonds. The water is itself split into H and\\nOH. One portion of the severed compound then bonds with the hydrogen atom, and the other portion bonds\\nwith the hydroxyl group.\\nThese reactions are reversible, and play an important role in the chemistry of organic compounds (which will be\\ndiscussed shortly).\\n56 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A molecule of water is released as a byproduct during dehydration reactions. (b) In\\nhydrolysis, the covalent bond between two monomers is split by the addition of a hydrogen atom to one and a hydroxyl group to the other,\\nwhich requires the contribution of one molecule of water.\\nSalts\\nRecall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more\\nelectrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes\\nnegatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions\\nother than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next.\\nA typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water\\nmolecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions,\\npulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart\\ninto molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an\\nelectrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and\\nprompting muscle contraction.\\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 57'),\n",

For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary\\nfats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.\\nAcids and Bases\\nAcids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the\\nproperties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.\\nAcids\\nAn acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (Figure 2.16a). Because an atom of hydrogen has\\njust one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly\\nlikely to participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H+ in solution; that is,\\nthey ionize completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong\\nacid because it releases all of its H+ in the stomach’s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills\\ningested microbes. Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen ions remain bonded within a\\ncompound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a\\nproton.\\n58 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\\nBases\\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\\nThe Concept of pH\\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 59'),\n",

At this\\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.

Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids.

The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates,\\nlipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of\\ncarbon.\\nThe Chemistry of Carbon\\nWhat makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four\\nelectrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to\\ncomplete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or\\naccepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.\\nCommonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon\\nskeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather,\\ncarbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and\\nhydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this\\nchapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.\\nMany combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or\\nnitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms\\nbond may also be part of a functional group. A functional group is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds\\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 61'),\n",

Any large molecule is referred to as macromolecule (macro- =\\n“large”), and the organic compounds in this section all fit this description. However, some macromolecules are\\nmade up of several “copies” of single units called monomer (mono- = “one”; -mer = “part”). Like beads in a long\\nnecklace, these monomers link by covalent bonds to form long polymers (poly- = “many”). There are many\\nexamples of monomers and polymers among the organic compounds.\\nMonomers form polymers by engaging in dehydration synthesis (see Figure 2.14). As was noted earlier, this reaction\\nresults in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the\\nother gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = “rupture”). The bonds\\nbetween their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to\\none monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.\\nCarbohydrates\\nThe term carbohydrate means “hydrated carbon.” Recall that the root hydro- indicates water. A carbohydrate is a\\nmolecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; in most carbohydrates, hydrogen and oxygen are found in the\\nsame two-to-one relative proportions they have in water.

Five monosaccharides are important in the body. Three of these\\nare the hexose sugars, so called because they each contain six atoms of carbon. These are glucose, fructose, and\\ngalactose, shown in Figure 2.18a. The remaining monosaccharides are the two pentose sugars, each of which\\ncontains five atoms of carbon. They are ribose and deoxyribose, shown in Figure 2.18b.\\n62 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Grains, fruits, and legumes and other vegetables provide\\nmost of the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.\\nAlthough most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose.\\nMoreover, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, spinal cord, and through the peripheral nervous system, as well as red\\nblood cells, can use only glucose for fuel. In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine\\ntriphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of a ribose sugar, an\\nadenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and\\nthus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O2) than in pathways that do\\nnot use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\\nwritten:\\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure. For\\ninstance, some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids\\nto produce glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.\\nLipids\\nA lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons. The few oxygen atoms they\\ncontain are often at the periphery of the molecule. Their nonpolar hydrocarbons make all lipids hydrophobic. In\\nwater, lipids do not form a true solution, but they may form an emulsion, which is the term for a mixture of solutions\\nthat do not mix well.\\nTriglycerides\\nA triglyceride is one of the most common dietary lipid groups, and the type found most abundantly in body tissues.\\nThis compound, which is commonly referred to as a fat, is formed from the synthesis of two types of molecules\\n(Figure 2.21):\\n• A glycerol backbone at the core of triglycerides, consists of three carbon atoms.\\n• Three fatty acids, long chains of hydrocarbons with a carboxyl group and a methyl group at opposite ends,\\nextend from each of the carbons of the glycerol.\\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 65'),\n",

Glycerol gives up hydrogen atoms from its hydroxyl groups at each\\nbond, and the carboxyl group on each fatty acid chain gives up a hydroxyl group. A total of three water molecules are\\nthereby released.\\nFatty acid chains that have no double carbon bonds anywhere along their length and therefore contain the maximum\\nnumber of hydrogen atoms are called saturated fatty acids. These straight, rigid chains pack tightly together and are\\nsolid or semi-solid at room temperature (Figure 2.22a). Butter and lard are examples, as is the fat found on a steak\\nor in your own body. In contrast, fatty acids with one double carbon bond are kinked at that bond (Figure 2.22b).\\nThese monounsaturated fatty acids are therefore unable to pack together tightly, and are liquid at room\\ntemperature. Polyunsaturated fatty acids contain two or more double carbon bonds, and are also liquid at room\\ntemperature. Plant oils such as olive oil typically contain both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\\nFIGURE 2.22 Fatty Acid Shapes The level of saturation of a fatty acid affects its shape. (a) Saturated fatty acid chains are straight. (b)\\nUnsaturated fatty acid chains are kinked.\\nWhereas a diet high in saturated fatty acids increases the risk of heart disease, a diet high in unsaturated fatty acids\\nis thought to reduce the risk. This is especially true for the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids found in cold-water fish\\nsuch as salmon. These fatty acids have their first double carbon bond at the third hydrocarbon from the methyl\\ngroup (referred to as the omega end of the molecule).\\nFinally, trans fatty acids found in some processed foods, including some stick and tub margarines, are thought to be\\neven more harmful to the heart and blood vessels than saturated fatty acids. Trans fats are created from\\nunsaturated fatty acids (such as corn oil) when chemically treated to produce partially hydrogenated fats.\\nAs a group, triglycerides are a major fuel source for the body. When you are resting or asleep, a majority of the\\nenergy used to keep you alive is derived from triglycerides stored in your fat (adipose) tissues. Triglycerides also fuel\\nlong, slow physical activity such as gardening or hiking, and contribute a modest percentage of energy for vigorous\\nphysical activity. Dietary fat also assists the absorption and transport of the nonpolar fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E,\\nand K. Additionally, stored body fat protects and cushions the body’s bones and internal organs, and acts as\\ninsulation to retain body heat.\\nFatty acids are also components of glycolipids, which are sugar-fat compounds found in the cell membrane.\\nLipoproteins are compounds in which the hydrophobic triglycerides are packaged in protein envelopes for transport\\n66 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids,\\na phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third\\nbinding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of\\nthe molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a\\nphospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as\\non the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to\\nhave hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate\\ngroups and nitrogen atom.\\nFIGURE 2.23 Other Important Lipids (a) Phospholipids are composed of two fatty acids, glycerol, and a phosphate group.

Although both plants and animals synthesize sterols, the type that\\nmakes the most important contribution to human structure and function is cholesterol, which is synthesized by the\\nliver in humans and animals and is also present in most animal-based foods. Like other lipids, cholesterol’s\\nhydrocarbons make it hydrophobic; however, it has a polar hydroxyl head that is hydrophilic. Cholesterol is an\\nimportant component of bile acids, compounds that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to\\nbile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate\\nprocesses at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids, cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where\\ntheir hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the flow of substances into and out of the cell.\\nProstaglandins\\nLike a hormone, a prostaglandin is one of a group of signaling molecules, but prostaglandins are derived from\\nunsaturated fatty acids (see Figure 2.23c). One reason that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are beneficial is\\nthat they stimulate the production of certain prostaglandins that help regulate aspects of blood pressure and\\ninflammation, and thereby reduce the risk for heart disease. Prostaglandins also sensitize nerves to pain. One class\\nof pain-relieving medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) works by reducing the effects of\\nprostaglandins.\\nProteins\\nYou might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and\\norgans. A protein is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the\\nkeratin in the epidermis of skin that protects underlying tissues, the collagen found in the dermis of skin, in bones,\\nand in the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. Proteins are also components of many of the body’s\\nfunctional chemicals, including digestive enzymes in the digestive tract, antibodies, the neurotransmitters that\\nneurons use to communicate with other cells, and the peptide-based hormones that regulate certain body functions\\n(for instance, growth hormone). While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all\\nproteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\\nMicrostructure of Proteins\\nProteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An amino acid is a molecule\\ncomposed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids\\ncontribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body\\nproteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of\\nthese amino acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following\\nare bonded:\\n• a hydrogen atom\\n• an alkaline (basic) amino group NH2 (see Table 2.1)\\n• an acidic carboxyl group COOH (see Table 2.1)\\n• a variable group\\nFIGURE 2.24 Structure of an Amino Acid\\n68 2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid–base balance.\\nWhat distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain\\nor an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique\\ncharacteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur\\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino\\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about\\n100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.\\nFIGURE 2.25 Peptide Bond Different amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via dehydration synthesis.\\nThe bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds R1 and R2 may be the same or different side chains.\\nThe body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot\\nbe synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.\\nFree amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures\\nwithin cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in\\nsufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.\\nShape of Proteins\\nJust as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential\\nto its function. A protein’s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is\\nmade (Figure 2.26a). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.\\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 69'),\n",

(c) The tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding\\nof the secondary structure. (d) The quaternary structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The\\nexample shown here is hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.\\nAlthough some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary\\nstructures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the\\npolypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of\\nstring and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not\\nmaintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions\\nof the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which\\nhydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or\\nbetween two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.\\nThe secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the\\nprotein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the\\nprimary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.\\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate\\npolypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide\\nsubunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in\\nred blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are\\ncalled beta chains.\\nWhen they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature.\\nDenaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means.

Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein\\ncatalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.\\nProteins Function as Enzymes\\nIf you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven\\nminutes before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop. In a similar way, without enzymes to\\ncatalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.\\nEnzymatic reactions—chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes—begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A\\nsubstrate is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (Figure\\n2.27). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to\\nthe fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding\\nto that substrate.\\nDue to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates, enzymes are known for their specificity.\\nIn fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure changes slightly to find the best fit between the\\ntransition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate and product) and the active site, just as a rubber\\nglove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification in the presence of substrate, along with the\\nsimultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit. Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme\\nfor each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes\\nhave the ability to act on several different structurally related substrates.\\nFIGURE 2.27 Steps in an Enzymatic Reaction According to the induced-fit model, the active site of the enzyme undergoes\\nconformational changes upon binding with the substrate.(a) Substrates approach active sites on enzyme. (b) Substrates bind to active sites,\\nproducing an enzyme–substrate complex. (c) Changes internal to the enzyme–substrate complex facilitate interaction of the substrates. (d)\\nProducts are released and the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to facilitate another enzymatic reaction.\\nBinding of a substrate produces an enzyme–substrate complex. It is likely that enzymes speed up chemical\\nreactions in part because the enzyme–substrate complex undergoes a set of temporary and reversible changes that\\ncause the substrates to be oriented toward each other in an optimal position to facilitate their interaction. This\\npromotes increased reaction speed. The enzyme then releases the product(s), and resumes its original shape. The\\nenzyme is then free to engage in the process again, and will do so as long as substrate remains.\\nOther Functions of Proteins\\nAdvertisements for protein bars, powders, and shakes all say that protein is important in building, repairing, and\\nmaintaining muscle tissue, but the truth is that proteins contribute to all body tissues, from the skin to the brain\\ncells. Also, certain proteins act as hormones, chemical messengers that help regulate body functions, For example,\\ngrowth hormone is important for skeletal growth, among other roles.\\nAs was noted earlier, the basic and acidic components enable proteins to function as buffers in maintaining\\nacid–base balance, but they also help regulate fluid–electrolyte balance.

They can thereby\\nproduce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both of which have many functions in the body.\\nThe body can use proteins for energy when carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate, and stores of glycogen and\\nadipose tissue become depleted. However, since there is no storage site for protein except functional tissues, using\\nprotein for energy causes tissue breakdown, and results in body wasting.\\nNucleotides\\nThe fourth type of organic compound important to human structure and function are the nucleotides (Figure 2.28).

(b) The nitrogen-containing bases of nucleotides. (c) The two pentose sugars of DNA and RNA.\\nNucleic Acids\\nThe nucleic acids differ in their type of pentose sugar. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores\\ngenetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus\\none phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base.

RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of\\nbase for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil.\\nThe nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines.

The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that\\nact as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000\\ngenes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which\\nlose their nuclei during development).

ATP is classified as a high energy compound because the two covalent bonds linking its three\\nphosphates store a significant amount of potential energy. In the body, the energy released from these high energy\\nbonds helps fuel the body’s activities, from muscle contraction to the transport of substances in and out of cells to\\nanabolic chemical reactions.\\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning 73'),\n",

You obtain these\\nelements from the foods you eat and the air you\\nbreathe. The smallest unit of an element that retains all\\nof the properties of that element is an atom. But,\\natoms themselves contain many subatomic particles,\\nthe three most important of which are protons,\\nneutrons, and electrons. These particles do not vary in\\nquality from one element to another; rather, what gives\\nan element its distinctive identification is the quantity\\nof its protons, called its atomic number. Protons and\\nneutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the\\nnumber of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass\\nnumber. Heavier and lighter versions of the same\\nelement can occur in nature because these versions\\nhave different numbers of neutrons. Different versions\\nof an element are called isotopes.\\nThe tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily\\nwith other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the\\nelectrons within the atom’s outermost electron shell,\\ncalled its valence shell. Helium, as well as larger atoms\\nwith eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to\\nparticipate in chemical reactions because they are\\nstable. All other atoms tend to accept, donate, or share\\nelectrons in a process that brings the electrons in their\\nvalence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to\\ntwo).\\n2.2 Chemical Bonds\\nEach moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon,\\nhydrogen, and the other elements of the human body\\nare making and breaking chemical bonds.

Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion,\\nfuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that\\nare necessary if their old bonds are to break and new\\nones to form. All molecules store potential energy,\\nwhich is released when their bonds are broken.\\nFour forms of energy essential to human functioning\\nare: chemical energy, which is stored and released as\\nchemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical\\nenergy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant\\nenergy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and\\nelectrical energy, the power of moving electrons.\\nChemical reactions begin with reactants and end with\\nproducts. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together,\\na process that requires energy, whereas decomposition\\nreactions break the bonds within a reactant and\\nthereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds\\nare both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.\\nThe rate at which chemical reactions occur is\\ninfluenced by several properties of the reactants:\\ntemperature, concentration and pressure, and the\\npresence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a\\ncatalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in\\nthe human body.\\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to\\nHuman Functioning\\nInorganic compounds essential to human functioning\\ninclude water, salts, acids, and bases. These\\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\\nof this normal range.\\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\\nFunctioning\\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds.

Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid\\nin the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone\\nattached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are\\ncompounds composed of a diglyceride with a\\nphosphate group attached at the molecule’s head.

Cellular and\\ndevelopmental biologists study how the continued division of a single cell leads to such complexity and\\ndifferentiation.\\nConsider the difference between a structural cell in the skin and a nerve cell. A structural skin cell may be shaped\\nlike a flat plate (squamous) and live only for a short time before it is shed and replaced.

With their long winding appendages, nerve cells can communicate with\\none another and with other types of body cells and send rapid signals that inform the organism about its\\nenvironment and allow it to interact with that environment. These differences illustrate one very important theme\\nthat is consistent at all organizational levels of biology: the form of a structure is optimally suited to perform\\nparticular functions assigned to that structure.

Homeostasis is a term used in biology that\\nrefers to a dynamic state of balance within parameters that are compatible with life. For example, living cells require\\na water-based environment to survive in, and there are various physical (anatomical) and physiological mechanisms\\nthat keep all of the trillions of living cells in the human body moist. This is one aspect of homeostasis. When a\\nparticular parameter, such as blood pressure or blood oxygen content, moves far enough out of homeostasis\\n(generally becoming too high or too low), illness or disease—and sometimes death—inevitably results.\\nThe concept of a cell started with microscopic observations of dead cork tissue by scientist Robert Hooke in 1665.\\nWithout realizing their function or importance, Hook coined the term “cell” based on the resemblance of the small\\nsubdivisions in the cork to the rooms that monks inhabited, called cells. About ten years later, Antonie van\\nLeeuwenhoek became the first person to observe living and moving cells under a microscope. In the century that\\nfollowed, the theory that cells represented the basic unit of life would develop.

As the outer layer of your skin separates your body from its environment, the cell membrane (also\\nknown as the plasma membrane) separates the inner contents of a cell from its exterior environment. This cell\\nmembrane provides a protective barrier around the cell and regulates which materials can pass in or out.\\nStructure and Composition of the Cell Membrane\\nThe cell membrane is an extremely pliable structure composed primarily of back-to-back phospholipids (a\\n“bilayer”). Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various\\nproteins embedded within the membrane that have a variety of functions.\\nA single phospholipid molecule has a phosphate group on one end, called the “head,” and two side-by-side chains\\nof fatty acids that make up the lipid tails (Figure 3.2). The phosphate group is negatively charged, making the head\\npolar and hydrophilic—or “water loving.” A hydrophilic molecule (or region of a molecule) is one that is attracted to\\nwater. The phosphate heads are thus attracted to the water molecules of both the extracellular and intracellular\\nenvironments. The lipid tails, on the other hand, are uncharged, or nonpolar, and are hydrophobic—or “water\\nfearing.” A hydrophobic molecule (or region of a molecule) repels and is repelled by water. Some lipid tails consist\\nof saturated fatty acids and some contain unsaturated fatty acids. This combination adds to the fluidity of the tails\\nthat are constantly in motion. Phospholipids are thus amphipathic molecules. An amphipathic molecule is one that\\ncontains both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic region. In fact, soap works to remove oil and grease stains because it\\nhas amphipathic properties. The hydrophilic portion can dissolve in water while the hydrophobic portion can trap\\ngrease in micelles that then can be washed away.\\n82 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Unsaturated fatty acids result in kinks in the hydrophobic tails.\\nThe cell membrane consists of two adjacent layers of phospholipids. The lipid tails of one layer face the lipid tails of\\nthe other layer, meeting at the interface of the two layers. The phospholipid heads face outward, one layer exposed\\nto the interior of the cell and one layer exposed to the exterior (Figure 3.3). Because the phosphate groups are polar\\nand hydrophilic, they are attracted to water in the intracellular fluid. Intracellular fluid (ICF) is the fluid interior of\\nthe cell. The phosphate groups are also attracted to the extracellular fluid. Extracellular fluid (ECF) is the fluid\\nenvironment outside the enclosure of the cell membrane. Interstitial fluid (IF) is the term given to extracellular\\nfluid not contained within blood vessels. Because the lipid tails are hydrophobic, they meet in the inner region of the\\nmembrane, excluding watery intracellular and extracellular fluid from this space. The cell membrane has many\\nproteins, as well as other lipids (such as cholesterol), that are associated with the phospholipid bilayer. An important\\nfeature of the membrane is that it remains fluid; the lipids and proteins in the cell membrane are not rigidly locked in\\nplace.\\nFIGURE 3.3 Phospholipid Bilayer The phospholipid bilayer consists of two adjacent sheets of phospholipids, arranged tail to tail.

A receptor is a type of recognition protein that can selectively bind a specific\\nmolecule outside the cell, and this binding induces a chemical reaction within the cell. A ligand is the specific\\nmolecule that binds to and activates a receptor. Some integral proteins serve dual roles as both a receptor and an\\nion channel. One example of a receptor-ligand interaction is the receptors on nerve cells that bind\\nneurotransmitters, such as dopamine. When a dopamine molecule binds to a dopamine receptor protein, a channel\\nwithin the transmembrane protein opens to allow certain ions to flow into the cell.\\nSome integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins. A glycoprotein is a protein that has carbohydrate molecules\\nattached, which extend into the extracellular matrix. The attached carbohydrate tags on glycoproteins aid in cell\\nrecognition. The carbohydrates that extend from membrane proteins and even from some membrane lipids\\ncollectively form the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy-appearing coating around the cell formed from\\nglycoproteins and other carbohydrates attached to the cell membrane. The glycocalyx can have various roles. For\\nexample, it may have molecules that allow the cell to bind to another cell, it may contain receptors for hormones, or\\nit might have enzymes to break down nutrients. The glycocalyces found in a person’s body are products of that\\nperson’s genetic makeup. They give each of the individual’s trillions of cells the “identity” of belonging in the\\nperson’s body. This identity is the primary way that a person’s immune defense cells “know” not to attack the\\nperson’s own body cells, but it also is the reason organs donated by another person might be rejected.\\nPeripheral proteins are typically found on the inner or outer surface of the lipid bilayer but can also be attached to\\nthe internal or external surface of an integral protein. These proteins typically perform a specific function for the\\ncell. Some peripheral proteins on the surface of intestinal cells, for example, act as digestive enzymes to break down\\nnutrients to sizes that can pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.\\nTransport across the Cell Membrane\\nOne of the great wonders of the cell membrane is its ability to regulate the concentration of substances inside the\\ncell. These substances include ions such as Ca++, Na+, K+, and Cl–; nutrients including sugars, fatty acids, and amino\\nacids; and waste products, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which must leave the cell.\\nThe membrane’s lipid bilayer structure provides the first level of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed\\ntogether, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively\\npermeable. A membrane that has selective permeability allows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass\\nthrough it unaided. In the case of the cell membrane, only relatively small, nonpolar materials can move through the\\nlipid bilayer (remember, the lipid tails of the membrane are nonpolar). Some examples of these are other lipids,\\noxygen and carbon dioxide gases, and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials—like glucose, amino acids, and\\nelectrolytes—need some assistance to cross the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of\\nthe phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move through the membrane do so by one of two general methods,\\nwhich are categorized based on whether or not energy is required.

In contrast, active transport is the\\nmovement of substances across the membrane using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\\nPassive Transport\\nIn order to understand how substances move passively across a cell membrane, it is necessary to understand\\nconcentration gradients and diffusion. A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance\\nacross a space. Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally\\ndiffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no\\nmore concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the\\nsugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or\\nthe tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster\\nthan at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6° F thus also aids in diffusion of\\nparticles within the body.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of\\nmolecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?\\nWhenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell\\nmembranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so.\\nConsider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen\\n(O2) and CO2. O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\\nFIGURE 3.5 Simple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane The structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size. Charged atoms or molecules of any\\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer. Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to\\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane 85'),\n",

Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion process used for those substances that cannot\\ncross the lipid bilayer due to their size, charge, and/or polarity (Figure 3.6). A common example of facilitated\\ndiffusion is the movement of glucose into the cell, where it is used to make ATP. Although glucose can be more\\nconcentrated outside of a cell, it cannot cross the lipid bilayer via simple diffusion because it is both large and polar.\\nTo resolve this, a specialized carrier protein called the glucose transporter will transfer glucose molecules into the\\ncell to facilitate its inward diffusion.\\nFIGURE 3.6 Facilitated Diffusion (a) Facilitated diffusion of substances crossing the cell (plasma) membrane takes place with the help\\nof proteins such as channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins are less selective than carrier proteins, and usually mildly\\ndiscriminate between their cargo based on size and charge. (b) Carrier proteins are more selective, often only allowing one particular type\\nof molecule to cross.\\nAs an example, even though sodium ions (Na+) are highly concentrated outside of cells, these electrolytes are\\ncharged and cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer of the membrane. Their diffusion is facilitated by\\nmembrane proteins that form sodium channels (or “pores”), so that Na+ ions can move down their concentration\\ngradient from outside the cells to inside the cells. There are many other solutes that must undergo facilitated\\ndiffusion to move into a cell, such as amino acids, or to move out of a cell, such as wastes. Because facilitated\\ndiffusion is a passive process, it does not require energy expenditure by the cell.\\nWater also can move freely across the cell membrane of all cells, either through protein channels or by slipping\\nbetween the lipid tails of the membrane itself. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable\\nmembrane (Figure 3.7).\\n86 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

If a\\nmembrane is permeable to water, though not to a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by diffusing to the side of lower water\\nconcentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration). In the beaker on the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is\\nhypertonic.\\nThe movement of water molecules is not itself regulated by some cells, so it is important that these cells are\\nexposed to an environment in which the concentration of solutes outside of the cells (in the extracellular fluid) is\\nequal to the concentration of solutes inside the cells (in the cytoplasm). Two solutions that have the same\\nconcentration of solutes are said to be isotonic (equal tension). When cells and their extracellular environments are\\nisotonic, the concentration of water molecules is the same outside and inside the cells, and the cells maintain their\\nnormal shape (and function).\\nOsmosis occurs when there is an imbalance of solutes outside of a cell versus inside the cell. A solution that has a\\nhigher concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypertonic, and water molecules tend to diffuse\\ninto a hypertonic solution (Figure 3.8). Cells in a hypertonic solution will shrivel as water leaves the cell via osmosis.\\nIn contrast, a solution that has a lower concentration of solutes than another solution is said to be hypotonic, and\\nwater molecules tend to diffuse out of a hypotonic solution. Cells in a hypotonic solution will take on too much water\\nand swell, with the risk of eventually bursting. A critical aspect of homeostasis in living things is to create an internal\\nenvironment in which all of the body’s cells are in an isotonic solution. Various organ systems, particularly the\\nkidneys, work to maintain this homeostasis.\\nFIGURE 3.8 Concentration of Solutions A hypertonic solution has a solute concentration higher than another solution. An isotonic\\nsolution has a solute concentration equal to another solution. A hypotonic solution has a solute concentration lower than another solution.\\nAnother mechanism besides diffusion to passively transport materials between compartments is filtration. Unlike\\ndiffusion of a substance from where it is more concentrated to less concentrated, filtration uses a hydrostatic\\npressure gradient that pushes the fluid—and the solutes within it—from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure\\narea. Filtration is an extremely important process in the body. For example, the circulatory system uses filtration to\\nmove plasma and substances across the endothelial lining of capillaries and into surrounding tissues, supplying\\ncells with the nutrients. Filtration pressure in the kidneys provides the mechanism to remove wastes from the\\nbloodstream.\\nActive Transport\\nFor all of the transport methods described above, the cell expends no energy. Membrane proteins that aid in the\\npassive transport of substances do so without the use of ATP. During active transport, ATP is required to move a\\nsubstance across a membrane, often with the help of protein carriers, and usually against its concentration gradient.\\nOne of the most common types of active transport involves proteins that serve as pumps.

The Na+/K+ pump is an important ion pump found in the membranes of many types of cells.\\nThese pumps are particularly abundant in nerve cells, which are constantly pumping out sodium ions and pulling in\\npotassium ions to maintain an electrical gradient across their cell membranes. An electrical gradient is a difference\\nin electrical charge across a space. In the case of nerve cells, for example, the electrical gradient exists between the\\ninside and outside of the cell, with the inside being negatively-charged (at around -70 mV) relative to the outside.\\nThe negative electrical gradient is maintained because each Na+/K+ pump moves three Na+ ions out of the cell and\\ntwo K+ ions into the cell for each ATP molecule that is used (Figure 3.9). This process is so important for nerve cells\\nthat it accounts for the majority of their ATP usage.\\nFIGURE 3.9 Sodium-Potassium Pump The sodium-potassium pump is found in many cell (plasma) membranes. Powered by ATP, the\\npump moves sodium and potassium ions in opposite directions, each against its concentration gradient. In a single cycle of the pump, three\\nsodium ions are extruded from and two potassium ions are imported into the cell.\\nActive transport pumps can also work together with other active or passive transport systems to move substances\\nacross the membrane. For example, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a high concentration of sodium ions\\noutside of the cell. Therefore, if the cell needs sodium ions, all it has to do is open a passive sodium channel, as the\\nconcentration gradient of the sodium ions will drive them to diffuse into the cell. In this way, the action of an active\\ntransport pump (the sodium-potassium pump) powers the passive transport of sodium ions by creating a\\nconcentration gradient. When active transport powers the transport of another substance in this way, it is called\\nsecondary active transport.\\nSymporters are secondary active transporters that move two substances in the same direction. For example, the\\nsodium-glucose symporter uses sodium ions to “pull” glucose molecules into the cell. Because cells store glucose\\nfor energy, glucose is typically at a higher concentration inside of the cell than outside. However, due to the action of\\nthe sodium-potassium pump, sodium ions will easily diffuse into the cell when the symporter is opened. The flood of\\nsodium ions through the symporter provides the energy that allows glucose to move through the symporter and into\\nthe cell, against its concentration gradient.\\nConversely, antiporters are secondary active transport systems that transport substances in opposite directions. For\\nexample, the sodium-hydrogen ion antiporter uses the energy from the inward flood of sodium ions to move\\nhydrogen ions (H+) out of the cell. The sodium-hydrogen antiporter is used to maintain the pH of the cell's interior.\\nOther forms of active transport do not involve membrane carriers. Endocytosis (bringing “into the cell”) is the\\nprocess of a cell ingesting material by enveloping it in a portion of its cell membrane, and then pinching off that\\nportion of membrane (Figure 3.10). Once pinched off, the portion of membrane and its contents becomes an\\nindependent, intracellular vesicle. A vesicle is a membranous sac—a spherical and hollow organelle bounded by a\\nlipid bilayer membrane.

Cells regulate the endocytosis of specific substances via receptor-\\nmediated endocytosis. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is endocytosis by a portion of the cell membrane that\\ncontains many receptors that are specific for a certain substance. Once the surface receptors have bound sufficient\\namounts of the specific substance (the receptor’s ligand), the cell will endocytose the part of the cell membrane\\ncontaining the receptor-ligand complexes. Iron, a required component of hemoglobin, is endocytosed by red blood\\ncells in this way. Iron is bound to a protein called transferrin in the blood. Specific transferrin receptors on red blood\\ncell surfaces bind the iron-transferrin molecules, and the cell endocytoses the receptor-ligand complexes.\\nIn contrast with endocytosis, exocytosis (taking “out of the cell”) is the process of a cell exporting material using\\nvesicular transport (Figure 3.11).

This is particularly important in the epithelial lining of the respiratory system.\\nRespiratory epithelial cells secrete mucus, which serves to trap dust, bacteria, and other debris. A cilium (plural\\n= cilia) is one of the hair-like appendages found on certain cells. Cilia on the epithelial cells move the mucus and\\nits trapped particles up the airways away from the lungs and toward the outside. In order to be effectively\\nmoved upward, the mucus cannot be too viscous; rather it must have a thin, watery consistency. The transport\\nof Cl– and the maintenance of an electronegative environment outside of the cell attract positive ions such as\\nNa+ to the extracellular space. The accumulation of both Cl– and Na+ ions in the extracellular space creates\\nsolute-rich mucus, which has a low concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water\\nmoves from cells and extracellular matrix into the mucus, “thinning” it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory\\nsystem, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down to be propelled out of the respiratory system.\\nIf the CFTR channel is absent, Cl– ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing\\nthem from drawing positive ions.

These two types of ER perform some very\\ndifferent functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER (RER) is so-\\ncalled because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules—organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a\\nbumpy appearance. A ribosome is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two\\nribosomal RNA subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis.\\nSmooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.\\nOne of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids. The smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids,\\nthe main component of biological membranes, as well as steroid hormones. For this reason, cells that produce large\\nquantities of such hormones, such as those of the female ovaries and male testes, contain large amounts of smooth\\nER. In addition to lipid synthesis, the smooth ER also sequesters (i.e., stores) and regulates the concentration of\\ncellular Ca++, a function extremely important in cells of the nervous system where Ca++ is the trigger for\\nneurotransmitter release. The smooth ER additionally metabolizes some carbohydrates and performs a\\ndetoxification role, breaking down certain toxins.\\nIn contrast with the smooth ER, the primary job of the rough ER is the synthesis and modification of proteins\\ndestined for the cell membrane or for export from the cell. For this protein synthesis, many ribosomes attach to the\\nER (giving it the studded appearance of rough ER).

It is along this inner membrane that a series of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules perform\\nthe biochemical reactions of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored in nutrient molecules (such\\nas glucose) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP\\nconstantly, and so the mitochondria are constantly at work. Oxygen molecules are required during cellular\\nrespiration, which is why you must constantly breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that uses huge\\namounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP is required to sustain muscle contraction. As a result, muscle\\ncells are packed full of mitochondria. Nerve cells also need large quantities of ATP to run their sodium-potassium\\npumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be loaded with over a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone\\ncell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a couple hundred mitochondria.\\nFIGURE 3.16 Mitochondrion The mitochondria are the energy-conversion factories of the cell.

In\\ncontrast to the digestive enzymes found in lysosomes, the enzymes within peroxisomes serve to transfer hydrogen\\natoms from various molecules to oxygen, producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this way, peroxisomes neutralize\\npoisons such as alcohol. In order to appreciate the importance of peroxisomes, it is necessary to understand the\\nconcept of reactive oxygen species.\\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles 95'),\n",

Examples of\\nROS include the hydroxyl radical OH, H2O2, and superoxide ( ). Some ROS are important for certain cellular\\nfunctions, such as cell signaling processes and immune responses against foreign substances.

The cytoskeleton is a group of fibrous proteins that provide structural support for cells, but this\\nis only one of the functions of the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components are also critical for cell motility, cell\\nreproduction, and transportation of substances within the cell.\\nThe cytoskeleton forms a complex thread-like network throughout the cell consisting of three different kinds of\\nprotein-based filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 3.18). The thickest of the\\nthree is the microtubule, a structural filament composed of subunits of a protein called tubulin. Microtubules\\nmaintain cell shape and structure, help resist compression of the cell, and play a role in positioning the organelles\\nwithin the cell. Microtubules also make up two types of cellular appendages important for motion: cilia and flagella.\\nCilia are found on many cells of the body, including the epithelial cells that line the airways of the respiratory\\nsystem. Cilia move rhythmically; they beat constantly, moving waste materials such as dust, mucus, and bacteria\\nupward through the airways, away from the lungs and toward the mouth. Beating cilia on cells in the female\\nfallopian tubes move egg cells from the ovary towards the uterus. A flagellum (plural = flagella) is an appendage\\nlarger than a cilium and specialized for cell locomotion. The only flagellated cell in humans is the sperm cell that\\nmust propel itself towards female egg cells.\\nFIGURE 3.18 The Three Components of the Cytoskeleton The cytoskeleton consists of (a) microtubules, (b) microfilaments, and (c)\\nintermediate filaments. The cytoskeleton plays an important role in maintaining cell shape and structure, promoting cellular movement,\\nand aiding cell division.\\nA very important function of microtubules is to set the paths (somewhat like railroad tracks) along which the genetic\\nmaterial can be pulled (a process requiring ATP) during cell division, so that each new daughter cell receives the\\nappropriate set of chromosomes. Two short, identical microtubule structures called centrioles are found near the\\nnucleus of cells. A centriole can serve as the cellular origin point for microtubules extending outward as cilia or\\nflagella or can assist with the separation of DNA during cell division. Microtubules grow out from the centrioles by\\nadding more tubulin subunits, like adding additional links to a chain.\\nIn contrast with microtubules, the microfilament is a thinner type of cytoskeletal filament (see Figure 3.18b). Actin,\\naccepted than the former. However, many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative damage does contribute to\\nthe aging process. Research has shown that reducing oxidative damage can result in a longer lifespan in certain\\norganisms such as yeast, worms, and fruit flies. Conversely, increasing oxidative damage can shorten the\\nlifespan of mice and worms. Interestingly, a manipulation called calorie-restriction (moderately restricting the\\ncaloric intake) has been shown to increase life span in some laboratory animals. It is believed that this increase\\nis at least in part due to a reduction of oxidative stress. However, a long-term study of primates with calorie-\\nrestriction showed no increase in their lifespan. A great deal of additional research will be required to better\\nunderstand the link between reactive oxygen species and aging.\\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles 97'),\n",

In\\nmuscle cells, these long actin strands, called thin filaments, are “pulled” by thick filaments of the myosin protein to\\ncontract the cell.\\nActin also has an important role during cell division. When a cell is about to split in half during cell division, actin\\nfilaments work with myosin to create a cleavage furrow that eventually splits the cell down the middle, forming two\\nnew cells from the original cell.\\nThe final cytoskeletal filament is the intermediate filament. As its name would suggest, an intermediate filament is\\na filament intermediate in thickness between the microtubules and microfilaments (see Figure 3.18c). Intermediate\\nfilaments are made up of long fibrous subunits of a protein called keratin that are wound together like the threads\\nthat compose a rope. Intermediate filaments, in concert with the microtubules, are important for maintaining cell\\nshape and structure.

The nucleolus is a region of the nucleus that is responsible for manufacturing the RNA necessary for\\nconstruction of ribosomes. Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cell’s nucleus through the\\nnuclear pores.\\nThe genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in\\nstrands of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure\\n3.22). Along the chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single,\\nwrapped DNA-histone complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded\\nnecklace, in which the string is the DNA and the beads are the associated histones. When a cell is in the process of\\ndivision, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, so that the DNA can be safely transported to the “daughter\\ncells.” The chromosome is composed of DNA and proteins; it is the condensed form of chromatin. It is estimated\\nthat humans have almost 22,000 genes distributed on 46 chromosomes.\\nFIGURE 3.22 DNA Macrostructure Strands of DNA are wrapped around supporting histones. These proteins are increasingly bundled\\nand condensed into chromatin, which is packed tightly into chromosomes when the cell is ready to divide.\\nDNA Replication\\nIn order for an organism to grow, develop, and maintain its health, cells must reproduce themselves by dividing to\\nproduce two new daughter cells, each with the full complement of DNA as found in the original cell. Billions of new\\ncells are produced in an adult human every day. Only very few cell types in the body do not divide, including nerve\\ncells, skeletal muscle fibers, and cardiac muscle cells. The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells\\nof the skin and gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being\\nrubbed off of the surface by friction.\\nA DNA molecule is made of two strands that “complement” each other in the sense that the molecules that\\ncompose the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a\\nlong, twisted ladder. This double helix can be constructed easily because the two strands are antiparallel, meaning\\nthe two strands run in opposite directions. Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and\\nphosphate groups (Figure 3.23). The two sides of the ladder are not identical, but are complementary. These two\\nbackbones are bonded to each other across pairs of protruding bases, each bonded pair forming one “rung,” or\\ncross member.

This refers to the fact\\nthat DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein.\\nMost structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a\\ncell carries out are completed with the help of proteins. One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes,\\nwhich help speed up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical\\nbiochemical reactions include building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA\\nreplication or synthesis of microtubules) and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as\\nwhen harvesting chemical energy from nutrient molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure\\nto involve proteins. Just as the cell’s genome describes its full complement of DNA, a cell’s proteome is its full\\ncomplement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A gene is a functional segment of DNA that provides\\nthe genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene provides the code necessary to construct\\na particular protein. Gene expression, which transforms the information coded in a gene to a final gene product,\\nultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.\\nThe interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino\\nacid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an\\namino acid sequence. A triplet is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar\\nto the way in which the three-letter code d-o-g signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals\\nthe use of a particular amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\\nFIGURE 3.25 The Genetic Code DNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis 103'),\n",

Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26). A codon is a three-base sequence of mRNA, so-called because they\\ndirectly encode amino acids. Like DNA replication, there are three stages to transcription: initiation, elongation, and\\ntermination.\\nFIGURE 3.26 Transcription: from DNA to mRNA In the first of the two stages of making protein from DNA, a gene on the DNA\\nmolecule is transcribed into a complementary mRNA molecule.\\nStage 1: Initiation. A region at the beginning of the gene called a promoter—a particular sequence of\\nnucleotides—triggers the start of transcription.\\nStage 2: Elongation. Transcription starts when RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA segment. One strand, referred to\\nas the coding strand, becomes the template with the genes to be coded. The polymerase then aligns the correct\\nnucleic acid (A, C, G, or U) with its complementary base on the coding strand of DNA. RNA polymerase is an enzyme\\nthat adds new nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA. This process builds a strand of mRNA.\\nStage 3: Termination. At the end of the gene, a sequence of nucleotides called the terminator sequence causes the\\nnew RNA to fold up on itself. This fold causes the RNA to separate from the gene and from RNA polymerase, ending\\ntranscription.\\nBefore the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and proceeds to protein synthesis, it is modified in a number of ways.\\nFor this reason, it is often called a pre-mRNA at this stage. For example, your DNA, and thus complementary mRNA,\\ncontains long regions called non-coding regions that do not code for amino acids. Their function is still a mystery,\\nbut the process called splicing removes these non-coding regions from the pre-mRNA transcript (Figure 3.27). A\\nspliceosome—a structure composed of various proteins and other molecules—attaches to the mRNA and “splices”\\nor cuts out the non-coding regions. The removed segment of the transcript is called an intron. The remaining exons\\nare pasted together. An exon is a segment of RNA that remains after splicing. Interestingly, some introns that are\\nremoved from mRNA are not always non-coding. When different coding regions of mRNA are spliced out, different\\nvariations of the protein will eventually result, with differences in structure and function. This process results in a\\nmuch larger variety of possible proteins and protein functions. When the mRNA transcript is ready, it travels out of\\nthe nucleus and into the cytoplasm.\\n104 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a\\npolypeptide. Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation,\\nand second, a substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator’s “desk.” Both\\nof these requirements are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the\\nribosome.\\nRemember that many of a cell’s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of\\nproteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a type of RNA that, together with proteins,\\ncomposes the structure of the ribosome. Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components, a small and\\na large subunit. When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to\\nthe mRNA. The ribosome provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule\\nwith the molecular “translators” that must decipher its code.\\nThe other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically “read” the mRNA\\ncodons. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the\\nribosome, and attaches each new amino acid to the last, building the polypeptide chain one-by-one. Thus tRNA\\ntransfers specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide. The tRNA molecules must be able to\\nrecognize the codons on mRNA and match them with the correct amino acid. The tRNA is modified for this function.\\nOn one end of its structure is a binding site for a specific amino acid. On the other end is a base sequence that\\nmatches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called\\nan anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for\\nglycine on one end. On the other end it contains an anticodon that complements the glycine codon (GGA is a codon\\nfor glycine, and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU). Equipped with its particular cargo and matching\\nanticodon, a tRNA molecule can read its recognized mRNA codon and bring the corresponding amino acid to the\\ngrowing chain (Figure 3.28).\\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis 105'),\n",

Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an mRNA transcript. The\\nelongation stage involves the recognition of a tRNA anticodon with the next mRNA codon in the sequence. Once the\\nanticodon and codon sequences are bound (remember, they are complementary base pairs), the tRNA presents its\\namino acid cargo and the growing polypeptide strand is attached to this next amino acid. This attachment takes\\nplace with the assistance of various enzymes and requires energy.

A polyribosome is a string of ribosomes translating a single mRNA strand.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/ribosome) to learn about ribosomes.

While there\\nare a few cells in the body that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells, most neurons, and\\nsome muscle cells), most somatic cells divide regularly. A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all\\nhuman cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic\\ncells. Somatic cells contain two copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A\\nhomologous pair of chromosomes is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human\\nis a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of\\nhaving pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy.\\nCells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal\\ntract must be frequently replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the gut. But what\\ntriggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division? The cell cycle is the sequence of\\nevents in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then\\ndivides itself, generating two new cells.\\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division 107'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 123}, page_content='The Cell Cycle\\nOne “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.\\nInterphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase\\nmost of the time. Mitosis is the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new,\\nfully functional, nuclei are formed. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\\nInterphase\\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\\nits DNA.\\nFIGURE 3.30 Cell Cycle The two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (designated M), when the cell divides, and interphase,\\nwhen the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2 phases.\\nAfter the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G2 phase. The G2 phase is a second gap phase, during\\nwhich the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G1, S, and G2 phases,\\ncells will vary the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many\\ndays. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G2 phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these\\nphases, the G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting\\n(a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G0.\\nThe Structure of Chromosomes\\nBillions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase,\\nthe amount of DNA within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome. Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister\\nchromatid and is physically bound to the other copy.(Note that the term \"sister chromatid\" is used regardless of the\\nsex of the person.) The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another. Because a human\\ncell has 46 chromosomes, during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 × 2) in the cell. Make sure not to confuse\\nthe concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous\\npair of chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one from each parent) (Figure\\n3.31).\\n108 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Each member of the pair was separately inherited from one parent. Each chromosome in the\\nhomologous pair is also bound to an identical sister chromatid, which is produced by DNA replication, and results in the familiar “X” shape.\\nMitosis and Cytokinesis\\nThe mitotic phase of the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major\\nprocesses. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and\\ndistributed between its two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells.\\nMitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order:\\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The process is then followed by cytokinesis.\\nFIGURE 3.32 Cell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis The stages of cell division oversee the separation of identical genetic\\nmaterial into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.\\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division 109'),\n",

During prophase, each chromosome becomes visible with its identical partner attached, forming the\\nfamiliar X-shape of sister chromatids. The nucleolus disappears early during this phase, and the nuclear envelope\\nalso disintegrates.\\nA major occurrence during prophase concerns a very important structure that contains the origin site for\\nmicrotubule growth. Recall the cellular structures called centrioles that serve as origin points from which\\nmicrotubules extend. These tiny structures also play a very important role during mitosis. A centrosome is a pair of\\ncentrioles together. The cell contains two centrosomes side-by-side, which begin to move apart during prophase. As\\nthe centrosomes migrate to two different sides of the cell, microtubules begin to extend from each like long fingers\\nfrom two hands extending toward each other. The mitotic spindle is the structure composed of the centrosomes\\nand their emerging microtubules.\\nNear the end of prophase there is an invasion of the nuclear area by microtubules from the mitotic spindle. The\\nnuclear membrane has disintegrated, and the microtubules attach themselves to the centromeres that adjoin pairs\\nof sister chromatids. The kinetochore is a protein structure on the centromere that is the point of attachment\\nbetween the mitotic spindle and the sister chromatids. This stage is referred to as late prophase or “prometaphase”\\nto indicate the transition between prophase and metaphase.\\nMetaphase is the second stage of mitosis. During this stage, the sister chromatids, with their attached microtubules,\\nline up along a linear plane in the middle of the cell. A metaphase plate forms between the centrosomes that are\\nnow located at either end of the cell. The metaphase plate is the name for the plane through the center of the\\nspindle on which the sister chromatids are positioned. The microtubules are now poised to pull apart the sister\\nchromatids and bring one from each pair to each side of the cell.\\nAnaphase is the third stage of mitosis. Anaphase takes place over a few minutes, when the pairs of sister\\nchromatids are separated from one another, forming individual chromosomes once again. These chromosomes are\\npulled to opposite ends of the cell by their kinetochores, as the microtubules shorten. Each end of the cell receives\\none partner from each pair of sister chromatids, ensuring that the two new daughter cells will contain identical\\ngenetic material.\\nTelophase is the final stage of mitosis. Telophase is characterized by the formation of two new daughter nuclei at\\neither end of the dividing cell. These newly formed nuclei surround the genetic material, which uncoils such that the\\nchromosomes return to loosely packed chromatin. Nucleoli also reappear within the new nuclei, and the mitotic\\nspindle breaks apart, each new cell receiving its own complement of DNA, organelles, membranes, and centrioles.\\nAt this point, the cell is already beginning to split in half as cytokinesis begins.\\nThe cleavage furrow is a contractile band made up of microfilaments that forms around the midline of the cell\\nduring cytokinesis. (Recall that microfilaments consist of actin.) This contractile band squeezes the two cells apart\\nuntil they finally separate. Two new cells are now formed. One of these cells (the “stem cell”) enters its own cell\\ncycle; able to grow and divide again at some future time. The other cell transforms into the functional cell of the\\ntissue, typically replacing an “old” cell there.\\nImagine a cell that completed mitosis but never underwent cytokinesis. In some cases, a cell may divide its genetic\\nmaterial and grow in size, but fail to undergo cytokinesis. This results in larger cells with more than one nucleus.\\nUsually this is an unwanted aberration and can be a sign of cancerous cells.\\nCell Cycle Control\\nA very elaborate and precise system of regulation controls direct the way cells proceed from one phase to the next\\nin the cell cycle and begin mitosis. The control system involves molecules within the cell as well as external triggers.\\nThese internal and external control triggers provide “stop” and “advance” signals for the cell. Precise regulation of\\nthe cell cycle is critical for maintaining the health of an organism, and loss of cell cycle control can lead to cancer.\\nMechanisms of Cell Cycle Control\\nAs the cell proceeds through its cycle, each phase involves certain processes that must be completed before the cell\\nshould advance to the next phase. A checkpoint is a point in the cell cycle at which the cycle can be signaled to\\nmove forward or stopped. At each of these checkpoints, different varieties of molecules provide the stop or go\\n110 3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A cyclin is one of the primary classes of cell cycle control\\nmolecules (Figure 3.33). A cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is one of a group of molecules that work together with\\ncyclins to determine progression past cell checkpoints. By interacting with many additional molecules, these\\ntriggers push the cell cycle forward unless prevented from doing so by “stop” signals, if for some reason the cell is\\nnot ready. At the G1 checkpoint, the cell must be ready for DNA synthesis to occur. At the G2 checkpoint the cell\\nmust be fully prepared for mitosis. Even during mitosis, a crucial stop and go checkpoint in metaphase ensures that\\nthe cell is fully prepared to complete cell division. The metaphase checkpoint ensures that all sister chromatids are\\nproperly attached to their respective microtubules and lined up at the metaphase plate before the signal is given to\\nseparate them during anaphase.\\nFIGURE 3.33 Control of the Cell Cycle Cells proceed through the cell cycle under the control of a variety of molecules, such as cyclins\\nand cyclin-dependent kinases. These control molecules determine whether or not the cell is prepared to move into the following stage.\\nThe Cell Cycle Out of Control: Implications\\nMost people understand that cancer or tumors are caused by abnormal cells that multiply continuously. If the\\nabnormal cells continue to divide unstopped, they can damage the tissues around them, spread to other parts of the\\nbody, and eventually result in death. In healthy cells, the tight regulation mechanisms of the cell cycle prevent this\\nfrom happening, while failures of cell cycle control can cause unwanted and excessive cell division. Failures of\\ncontrol may be caused by inherited genetic abnormalities that compromise the function of certain “stop” and “go”\\nsignals. Environmental insult that damages DNA can also cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of\\nboth genetic predisposition and environmental factors lead to cancer.\\nThe process of a cell escaping its normal control system and becoming cancerous may actually happen throughout\\nthe body quite frequently. Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing cells that have\\nbecome cancerous and destroying them. However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and\\ncontinue to proliferate. If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign\\nand can usually be easily removed. If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant and the patient is\\ndiagnosed with cancer.\\nHOME OSTATIC IMB ALANCE S\\nCancer Arises from Homeostatic Imbalances\\nCancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide variety of genetic and environmental\\ncauses. Typically, mutations or aberrations in a cell’s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control systems lead\\nto cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell\\nfunction and health. While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety of intracellular molecules\\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division 111'),\n",

These signals are maintained in an\\nintricate balance so that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when it is ready. This homeostatic control of the\\ncell cycle can be thought of like a car’s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply just the right amount of\\nacceleration to maintain a desired speed, unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down.\\nSimilarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.\\nIn addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important\\nsignals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface\\nreceptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules, two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication\\nand cell division. In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a\\ncell cycle. For example, certain protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems with the DNA\\nand thus stop the cell from dividing, while other proteins signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair. Some\\ntumor suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular density, which indicates that the cell need not\\npresently divide. The latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth: normal cells exhibit a\\nphenomenon called “contact inhibition;” thus, extensive cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that\\nstops further cell division.\\nThese two contrasting classes of genes, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are like the accelerator and\\nbrake pedal of the cell’s own “cruise control system,” respectively. Under normal conditions, these stop and go\\nsignals are maintained in a homeostatic balance. Generally speaking, there are two ways that the cell’s cruise\\ncontrol can lose control: a malfunctioning (overactive) accelerator, or a malfunctioning (underactive) brake. When\\ncompromised through a mutation, or otherwise altered, proto-oncogenes can be converted to oncogenes, which\\nproduce oncoproteins that push a cell forward in its cycle and stimulate cell division even when it is undesirable to\\ndo so. For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive\\nDNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor\\nsuppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and\\nproliferation.\\nA delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately\\ncontrols the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate. Therefore, a disruption of this homeostatic\\nbalance can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous growths.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/mitosis) to learn about mitosis.

Because all cells in the body, beginning with the fertilized egg, contain the same DNA,\\nhow do the different cell types come to be so different? The answer is analogous to a movie script. The different\\nactors in a movie all read from the same script, however, they are each only reading their own part of the script.\\nSimilarly, all cells contain the same full complement of DNA, but each type of cell only “reads” the portions of DNA\\nthat are relevant to its own function. In biology, this is referred to as the unique genetic expression of each cell.\\nIn order for a cell to differentiate into its specialized form and function, it need only manipulate those genes (and\\nthus those proteins) that will be expressed, and not those that will remain silent. The primary mechanism by which\\ngenes are turned “on” or “off” is through transcription factors. A transcription factor is one of a class of proteins\\nthat bind to specific genes on the DNA molecule and either promote or inhibit their transcription (Figure 3.35).\\nFIGURE 3.35 Transcription Factors Regulate Gene Expression While each body cell contains the organism’s entire genome, different\\ncells regulate gene expression with the use of various transcription factors. Transcription factors are proteins that affect the binding of RNA\\npolymerase to a particular gene on the DNA molecule.\\nEveryday Connection\\nStem Cell Research\\nStem cell research aims to find ways to use stem cells to regenerate and repair cellular damage. Over time, most\\nadult cells undergo the wear and tear of aging and lose their ability to divide and repair themselves. Stem cells\\ndo not display a particular morphology or function. Adult stem cells, which exist as a small subset of cells in\\nmost tissues, keep dividing and can differentiate into a number of specialized cells generally formed by that\\ntissue. These cells enable the body to renew and repair body tissues.\\nThe mechanisms that induce a non-differentiated cell to become a specialized cell are poorly understood. In a\\nlaboratory setting, it is possible to induce stem cells to differentiate into specialized cells by changing the\\nphysical and chemical conditions of growth. Several sources of stem cells are used experimentally and are\\nclassified according to their origin and potential for differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are\\nextracted from embryos and are pluripotent. The adult stem cells that are present in many organs and\\ndifferentiated tissues, such as bone marrow and skin, are multipotent, being limited in differentiation to the\\ntypes of cells found in those tissues. The stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood are also multipotent, as\\nare cells from deciduous teeth (baby teeth). Researchers have recently developed induced pluripotent stem\\ncells (iPSCs) from mouse and human adult stem cells. These cells are genetically reprogrammed multipotent\\nadult cells that function like embryonic stem cells; they are capable of generating cells characteristic of all three\\ngerm layers.\\nBecause of their capacity to divide and differentiate into specialized cells, stem cells offer a potential treatment\\nfor diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (Figure 3.36). Cell-based therapy refers to treatment in which\\nstem cells induced to differentiate in a growth dish are injected into a patient to repair damaged or destroyed\\ncells or tissues. Many obstacles must be overcome for the application of cell-based therapy. Although embryonic\\nstem cells have a nearly unlimited range of differentiation potential, they are seen as foreign by the patient’s\\nimmune system and may trigger rejection.

During active transport, energy is\\nexpended to assist material movement across the\\nmembrane in a direction against their concentration\\ngradient. Active transport may take place with the help\\nof protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.\\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\\nThe internal environmental of a living cell is made up of\\na fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which\\nconsists mainly of water, but also contains various\\ndissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell\\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\\nthe health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and\\norganelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm.\\nMost organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane\\nsimilar to the cell membrane of the cell. The\\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\\noutside of the cell. Some of these protein products are\\nenzymes destined to break down unwanted material\\nand are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.\\nCells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes,\\nwhich are the organelles responsible for producing the\\ncell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals,\\nrespectively. Biochemical reactions within\\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\\nform chromosomes.\\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\\none contains one original strand and one newly\\nsynthesized complementary strand.\\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\\nthe protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the\\nmRNA detaches from the ribosome, and the protein is\\nreleased. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a\\nsingle mRNA molecule at once such that multiple\\nproteins can be manufactured from the mRNA\\nconcurrently.\\n3 • Chapter Review 119'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 135}, page_content='3.5 Cell Growth and Division\\nThe life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell\\ncycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an\\ninterphase before it is ready to replicate itself and\\nproduce daughter cells. This interphase includes two\\ngap phases (G1 and G2), as well as an S phase, during\\nwhich its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell\\ndivision. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by\\nchemical messengers both inside and outside the cell\\nthat provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement\\nfrom one phase to the next. Failures of these signals\\ncan result in cells that continue to divide\\nuncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.\\nOnce a cell has completed interphase and is ready for\\ncell division, it proceeds through four separate stages\\nof mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and\\ntelophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the\\ncytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter\\ncells. This process takes place in all normally dividing\\ncells of the body except for the germ cells that produce\\neggs and sperm.\\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\\nOne of the major areas of research in biology is that of\\nhow cells specialize to assume their unique structures\\nand functions, since all cells essentially originate from\\na single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process\\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops. A\\nstem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide\\nwithout limit as needed and can, under specific\\nconditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem\\ncells are divided into several categories according to\\ntheir potential to differentiate. While all somatic cells\\ncontain the exact same genome, different cell types\\nonly express some of those genes at any given time.\\nThese differences in gene expression ultimately dictate\\na cell’s unique morphological and physiological\\ncharacteristics. The primary mechanism that\\ndetermines which genes will be expressed and which\\nones will not is through the use of different\\ntranscription factor proteins, which bind to DNA and\\npromote or hinder the transcription of different genes.\\nThrough the action of these transcription factors, cells\\nspecialize into one of hundreds of different cell types in\\nthe human body.\\nInteractive Link Questions\\n1.

The cells within a tissue share a\\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\\ncells organized into tissues.\\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\\nand function.\\nThe Four Types of Tissues\\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\\n126 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These membranes line the coelomic cavities of the body, that\\nis, those cavities that do not open to the outside, and they cover the organs located within those cavities. They are\\nessentially membranous bags, with mesothelium lining the inside and connective tissue on the outside. Serous fluid\\nsecreted by the cells of the thin squamous mesothelium lubricates the membrane and reduces abrasion and friction\\nbetween organs. Serous membranes are identified according locations. Three serous membranes line the thoracic\\ncavity; the two pleura that cover the lungs and the pericardium that covers the heart.

It is a stratified squamous epithelial\\nmembrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external\\nenvironment and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens.\\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the structure and function of epithelial tissue\\n• Distinguish between tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap junctions\\n• Distinguish between simple epithelia and stratified epithelia, as well as between squamous, cuboidal, and\\ncolumnar epithelia\\n• Describe the structure and function of endocrine and exocrine glands and their respective secretions\\nMost epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body exposed to the\\noutside world and lining the outside of organs. Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin\\nis not the only area of the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well\\nas the urinary and reproductive systems, all of which are lined by an epithelium. Hollow organs and body cavities\\nthat do not connect to the exterior of the body, which includes, blood vessels and serous membranes, are lined by\\nendothelium (plural = endothelia), which is a type of epithelium.\\nEpithelial cells derive from all three major embryonic layers. The epithelia lining the skin, parts of the mouth and\\nnose, and the anus develop from the ectoderm. Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in\\nthe endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the\\nmesoderm and is called an endothelium.\\nAll epithelia share some important structural and functional features. This tissue is highly cellular, with little or no\\nextracellular material present between cells. Adjoining cells form a specialized intercellular connection between\\ntheir cell membranes called a cell junction. The epithelial cells exhibit polarity with differences in structure and\\nfunction between the exposed or apical facing surface of the cell and the basal surface close to the underlying body\\nstructures. The basal lamina, a mixture of glycoproteins and collagen, provides an attachment site for the\\nepithelium, separating it from underlying connective tissue. The basal lamina attaches to a reticular lamina, which\\nis secreted by the underlying connective tissue, forming a basement membrane that helps hold it all together.\\nEpithelial tissues are nearly completely avascular. For instance, no blood vessels cross the basement membrane to\\nenter the tissue, and nutrients must come by diffusion or absorption from underlying tissues or the surface. Many\\nepithelial tissues are capable of rapidly replacing damaged and dead cells. Sloughing off of damaged or dead cells is\\na characteristic of surface epithelium and allows our airways and digestive tracts to rapidly replace damaged cells\\nwith new cells.\\nGeneralized Functions of Epithelial Tissue\\nEpithelial tissues provide the body’s first line of protection from physical, chemical, and biological wear and tear.\\nThe cells of an epithelium act as gatekeepers of the body controlling permeability and allowing selective transfer of\\nmaterials across a physical barrier. All substances that enter the body must cross an epithelium. Some epithelia\\n130 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the\\nrespiratory tract secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains\\nmany secretory cells.\\nThe Epithelial Cell\\nEpithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins\\nbetween their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to\\nspecific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions,\\nsuch as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface.\\nCilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in\\nunison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it\\nhelps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that\\nsweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator\\nbecause it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous\\nblanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the\\nacidic environment of your stomach.\\nCell to Cell Junctions\\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. Three basic types of\\nconnections allow varying degrees of interaction between the cells: tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap\\njunctions (Figure 4.5).\\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue 131'),\n",

This enables the epithelia to\\nact as selective barriers. An anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial\\ntissues. Anchoring junctions are common on the lateral and basal surfaces of cells where they provide strong and\\nflexible connections. There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.\\nDesmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface\\nof the cell’s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the\\ncell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in\\nholding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix,\\nfor example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins\\ncalled integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.\\nIn contrast with the tight and anchoring junctions, a gap junction forms an intercellular passageway between the\\n132 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These junctions allow electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells, which coordinates function\\nin large groups of cells.\\nClassification of Epithelial Tissues\\nEpithelial tissues are classified according to the shape of the cells and number of the cell layers formed (Figure 4.6).\\nCell shapes can be squamous (flattened and thin), cuboidal (boxy, as wide as it is tall), or columnar (rectangular,\\ntaller than it is wide). Similarly, the number of cell layers in the tissue can be one—where every cell rests on the\\nbasal lamina—which is a simple epithelium, or more than one, which is a stratified epithelium and only the basal\\nlayer of cells rests on the basal lamina. Pseudostratified (pseudo- = “false”) describes tissue with a single layer of\\nirregularly shaped cells that give the appearance of more than one layer. Transitional describes a form of specialized\\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\\nFIGURE 4.6 Cells of Epithelial Tissue Simple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\\nformed by several layers of cells.\\nSimple Epithelium\\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells. The cells in\\nsimple squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal,\\nand elliptical, mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the\\nlymphatic and cardiovascular system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells. Simple squamous\\nepithelium, because of the thinness of the cell, is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is observed.\\nThe alveoli of lungs where gases diffuse, segments of kidney tubules, and the lining of capillaries are also made of\\nsimple squamous epithelial tissue. The mesothelium is a simple squamous epithelium that forms the surface layer\\nof the serous membrane that lines body cavities and internal organs. Its primary function is to provide a smooth and\\nprotective surface. Mesothelial cells are squamous epithelial cells that secrete a fluid that lubricates the\\nmesothelium.\\nIn simple cuboidal epithelium, the nucleus of the box-like cells appears round and is generally located near the\\ncenter of the cell. These epithelia are active in the secretion and absorptions of molecules. Simple cuboidal epithelia\\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue 133'),\n",

Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of\\nmolecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\\nfemale reproductive tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\\ntheir apical surfaces. These epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory\\nsystem, where the beating of the cilia helps remove particulate matter.\\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a\\nsingle layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the\\nappearance of stratification; but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach\\nthe apical surface. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\\nhave cilia.\\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells.

Stratified squamous epithelium is the most common type of stratified epithelium in the human\\nbody. The apical cells are squamous, whereas the basal layer contains either columnar or cuboidal cells. The top\\nlayer may be covered with dead cells filled with keratin. Mammalian skin is an example of this dry, keratinized,\\nstratified squamous epithelium. The lining of the mouth cavity is an example of an unkeratinized, stratified\\nsquamous epithelium. Stratified cuboidal epithelium and stratified columnar epithelium can also be found in\\ncertain glands and ducts, but are uncommon in the human body.\\nAnother kind of stratified epithelium is transitional epithelium, so-called because of the gradual changes in the\\nshapes of the apical cells as the bladder fills with urine. It is found only in the urinary system, specifically the ureters\\nand urinary bladder. When the bladder is empty, this epithelium is convoluted and has cuboidal apical cells with\\nconvex, umbrella shaped, apical surfaces. As the bladder fills with urine, this epithelium loses its convolutions and\\nthe apical cells transition from cuboidal to squamous. It appears thicker and more multi-layered when the bladder is\\nempty, and more stretched out and less stratified when the bladder is full and distended.

Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused\\ninto the bloodstream, and delivered to targets, in other words, cells that have receptors to bind the hormones. The\\nendocrine system is part of a major regulatory system coordinating the regulation and integration of body\\nresponses. A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\\nExocrine Glands\\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface.

These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest\\nand release their secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents\\nthrough a tubular duct. The duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more\\nbranches (Figure 4.9). In tubular glands, the ducts can be straight or coiled, whereas tubes that form pockets are\\nalveolar (acinar), such as the exocrine portion of the pancreas.

The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular\\nmaterial produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the\\nfunctioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein\\nfibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective\\ntissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells,\\nlarge amounts of amorphous ground substance, and protein fibers. The amount and structure of each component\\ncorrelates with the function of the tissue, from the rigid ground substance in bones supporting the body to the\\ninclusion of specialized cells; for example, a phagocytic cell that engulfs pathogens and also rids tissue of cellular\\ndebris.\\nFunctions of Connective Tissues\\nConnective tissues perform many functions in the body, but most importantly, they support and connect other\\ntissues; from the connective tissue sheath that surrounds muscle cells, to the tendons that attach muscles to bones,\\nand to the skeleton that supports the positions of the body. Protection is another major function of connective\\ntissue, in the form of fibrous capsules and bones that protect delicate organs and, of course, the skeletal system.\\nSpecialized cells in connective tissue defend the body from microorganisms that enter the body. Transport of fluid,\\nnutrients, waste, and chemical messengers is ensured by specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and\\nlymph. Adipose cells store surplus energy in the form of fat and contribute to the thermal insulation of the body.\\nEmbryonic Connective Tissue\\nAll connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (see Figure 4.3). The first connective tissue\\n140 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord,\\ncalled mucous connective tissue or Wharton’s jelly. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only\\nscattered mesenchymal cells throughout the body.\\nClassification of Connective Tissues\\nThe three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according to the characteristics of their ground\\nsubstance and the types of fibers found within the matrix (Table 4.1). Connective tissue proper includes loose\\nconnective tissue and dense connective tissue. Both tissues have a variety of cell types and protein fibers\\nsuspended in a viscous ground substance. Dense connective tissue is reinforced by bundles of fibers that provide\\ntensile strength, elasticity, and protection. In loose connective tissue, the fibers are loosely organized, leaving large\\nspaces in between. Supportive connective tissue—bone and cartilage—provide structure and strength to the body\\nand protect soft tissues. A few distinct cell types and densely packed fibers in a matrix characterize these tissues. In\\nbone, the matrix is rigid and described as calcified because of the deposited calcium salts. In fluid connective\\ntissue, in other words, lymph and blood, various specialized cells circulate in a watery fluid containing salts,\\nnutrients, and dissolved proteins.\\nConnective Tissue Examples\\nConnective tissue proper Supportive connective tissue Fluid connective tissue\\nLoose connective tissue\\n• Areolar\\n• Adipose\\n• Reticular\\nDense connective tissue\\n• Dense regular\\n• Elastic\\n• Dense-irregular\\nCartilage\\n• Hyaline\\n• Fibrocartilage\\n• Elastic\\nBone\\nBlood\\nLymph\\nTABLE 4.1\\nConnective Tissue Proper\\nFibroblasts are present in all connective tissue proper (Figure 4.12).

Polysaccharides and proteins secreted by\\nfibroblasts combine with extra-cellular fluids to produce a viscous ground substance that, with embedded fibrous\\nproteins, forms the extra-cellular matrix. As you might expect, a fibrocyte, a less active form of fibroblast, is the\\nsecond most common cell type in connective tissue proper.\\nAdipocytes are cells that store lipids as droplets that fill most of the cytoplasm. There are two basic types of\\nadipocytes: white and brown. The brown adipocytes store lipids as many droplets, and have high metabolic activity.\\nIn contrast, white fat adipocytes store lipids as a single large drop and are metabolically less active. Their\\neffectiveness at storing large amounts of fat is witnessed in obese individuals. The number and type of adipocytes\\ndepends on the tissue and location, and vary among individuals in the population.\\nThe mesenchymal cell is a multipotent adult stem cell. These cells can differentiate into any type of connective\\ntissue cells needed for repair and healing of damaged tissue.\\nThe macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of blood cell, which enters the connective tissue\\nmatrix from the blood vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune system, which is\\nthe body’s defense against potential pathogens and degraded host cells. When stimulated, macrophages release\\ncytokines, small proteins that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines recruit other cells of the immune system to\\ninfected sites and stimulate their activities. Roaming, or free, macrophages move rapidly by amoeboid movement,\\nengulfing infectious agents and cellular debris. In contrast, fixed macrophages are permanent residents of their\\ntissues.\\nThe mast cell, found in connective tissue proper, has many cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain the\\nchemical signals histamine and heparin. When irritated or damaged, mast cells release histamine, an inflammatory\\nmediator, which causes vasodilation and increased blood flow at a site of injury or infection, along with itching,\\nswelling, and redness you recognize as an allergic response. Like blood cells, mast cells are derived from\\nhematopoietic stem cells and are part of the immune system.\\nConnective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance\\nThree main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen\\nfiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while\\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.\\nReticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain\\nnarrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the\\nreticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the\\nparenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ).\\nAll of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of\\npolysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein\\ncore and polysaccharide branches. The proteoglycan attracts and traps available moisture forming the clear,\\nviscous, colorless matrix you now know as ground substance.\\nLoose Connective Tissue\\nLoose connective tissue is found between many organs where it acts both to absorb shock and bind tissues\\ntogether. It allows water, salts, and various nutrients to diffuse through to adjacent or imbedded cells and tissues.\\nAdipose tissue consists mostly of fat storage cells, with little extracellular matrix (Figure 4.13). A large number of\\ncapillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules. White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can\\nappear yellow and owes its color to carotene and related pigments from plant food. White fat contributes mostly to\\nlipid storage and can serve as insulation from cold temperatures and mechanical injuries.

Brown adipose tissue is more common in\\ninfants, hence the term “baby fat.” In adults, there is a reduced amount of brown fat and it is found mainly in the\\nneck and clavicular regions of the body. The many mitochondria in the cytoplasm of brown adipose tissue help\\nexplain its efficiency at metabolizing stored fat. Brown adipose tissue is thermogenic, meaning that as it breaks\\ndown fats, it releases metabolic heat, rather than producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a key molecule used in\\nmetabolism.\\nFIGURE 4.13 Adipose Tissue This is a loose connective tissue that consists of fat cells with little extracellular matrix.

It contains all the cell types and fibers previously described and is\\ndistributed in a random, web-like fashion. It fills the spaces between muscle fibers, surrounds blood and lymph\\nvessels, and supports organs in the abdominal cavity. Areolar tissue underlies most epithelia and represents the\\nconnective tissue component of epithelial membranes, which are described further in a later section.\\nReticular tissue is a mesh-like, supportive framework for soft organs such as lymphatic tissue, the spleen, and the\\nliver (Figure 4.14). Reticular cells produce the reticular fibers that form the network onto which other cells attach. It\\nderives its name from the Latin reticulus, which means “little net.”\\nFIGURE 4.14 Reticular Tissue This is a loose connective tissue made up of a network of reticular fibers that provides a supportive\\nframework for soft organs. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\\nDense Connective Tissue\\nDense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it\\ndisplays greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and\\nirregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance\\nto stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective\\ntissue, but in ligaments not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to\\ncollagen fibers, which allows the ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal\\nfolds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are elastic.\\nIn dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater\\nstrength in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a\\nmesh. In other tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same\\n4.3 • Connective Tissue Supports and Protects 143'),\n",

As you toss the ball high in the air, a burning pain shoots across your wrist and you drop the\\ntennis racket. That dull ache in the wrist that you ignored through the summer is now an unbearable pain. The\\ngame is over for now.\\nAfter examining your swollen wrist, the doctor in the emergency room announces that you have developed wrist\\ntendinitis. She recommends icing the tender area, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to ease\\nthe pain and to reduce swelling, and complete rest for a few weeks. She interrupts your protests that you cannot\\nstop playing. She issues a stern warning about the risk of aggravating the condition and the possibility of surgery.\\nShe consoles you by mentioning that well known tennis players such as Venus and Serena Williams and Rafael\\nNadal have also suffered from tendinitis related injuries.\\nWhat is tendinitis and how did it happen? Tendinitis is the inflammation of a tendon, the thick band of fibrous\\nconnective tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone. The condition causes pain and tenderness in the area\\naround a joint. On rare occasions, a sudden serious injury will cause tendinitis. Most often, the condition results\\nfrom repetitive motions over time that strain the tendons needed to perform the tasks.\\nPersons whose jobs and hobbies involve performing the same movements over and over again are often at the\\ngreatest risk of tendinitis. You hear of tennis and golfer’s elbow, jumper's knee, and swimmer’s shoulder. In all\\ncases, overuse of the joint causes a microtrauma that initiates the inflammatory response. Tendinitis is routinely\\ndiagnosed through a clinical examination. In case of severe pain, X-rays can be examined to rule out the\\npossibility of a bone injury. Severe cases of tendinitis can even tear loose a tendon. Surgical repair of a tendon is\\npainful. Connective tissue in the tendon does not have abundant blood supply and heals slowly.\\n144 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

Embedded within the cartilage matrix are chondrocytes, or cartilage\\ncells, and the space they occupy are called lacunae (singular = lacuna). A layer of dense irregular connective tissue,\\nthe perichondrium, encapsulates the cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue is avascular, thus all nutrients need to diffuse\\nthrough the matrix to reach the chondrocytes. This is a factor contributing to the very slow healing of cartilaginous\\ntissues.\\nThe three main types of cartilage tissue are hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage (Figure 4.16).\\nHyaline cartilage, the most common type of cartilage in the body, consists of short and dispersed collagen fibers\\nand contains large amounts of proteoglycans. Under the microscope, tissue samples appear clear. The surface of\\nhyaline cartilage is smooth. Both strong and flexible, it is found in the rib cage and nose and covers bones where\\nthey meet to form moveable joints. It makes up a template of the embryonic skeleton before bone formation. A\\nplate of hyaline cartilage at the ends of bone allows continued growth until adulthood. Fibrocartilage is tough\\nbecause it has thick bundles of collagen fibers dispersed through its matrix. Menisci in the knee joint and the\\nintervertebral discs are examples of fibrocartilage. Elastic cartilage contains elastic fibers as well as collagen and\\nproteoglycans. This tissue gives rigid support as well as elasticity. Tug gently at your ear lobes, and notice that the\\nlobes return to their initial shape. The external ear contains elastic cartilage.\\nWhile older adults are at risk for tendinitis because the elasticity of tendon tissue decreases with age, active\\npeople of all ages can develop tendinitis. Young athletes, dancers, and computer operators; anyone who\\nperforms the same movements constantly is at risk for tendinitis. Although repetitive motions are unavoidable in\\nmany activities and may lead to tendinitis, precautions can be taken that can lessen the probability of\\ndeveloping tendinitis. For active individuals, stretches before exercising and cross training or changing exercises\\nare recommended. For the passionate athlete, it may be time to take some lessons to improve technique. All of\\nthe preventive measures aim to increase the strength of the tendon and decrease the stress put on it.

When attached between two\\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\\nand read a chapter on anatomy.

The muscle cell, or myocyte, develops from myoblasts derived from the mesoderm. Myocytes and\\ntheir numbers remain relatively constant throughout life. Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded\\nby connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the\\nmembranes. The striation is due to the regular alternation of the contractile proteins actin and myosin, along with\\nthe structural proteins that couple the contractile proteins to connective tissues. The cells are multinucleated as a\\nresult of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber.\\nCardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. The cells of cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyocytes, also\\nappear striated under the microscope. Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a\\nsingle centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own\\nintrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. Cardiomyocyte attach to one another with specialized cell\\njunctions called intercalated discs. Intercalated discs have both anchoring junctions and gap junctions. Attached\\ncells form long, branching cardiac muscle fibers that are, essentially, a mechanical and electrochemical syncytium\\nallowing the cells to synchronize their actions. The cardiac muscle pumps blood through the body and is under\\ninvoluntary control.

What are the main parts of a nerve\\ncell?\\nNeurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell\\nbody includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the cell body and appear\\nas thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer\\nknown as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a\\nnerve cell and its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical\\ncompounds known as neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have several dendrites and a\\nsingle prominent axon. Bipolar neurons possess a single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar\\nneurons have only a single process extending out from the cell body, which divides into a functional dendrite and\\ninto a functional axon. When a neuron is sufficiently stimulated, it generates an action potential that propagates\\ndown the axon towards the synapse. If enough neurotransmitters are released at the synapse to stimulate the next\\nneuron or target, a response is generated.\\nThe second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells, which have been characterized as having a\\nsimple support role. The word “glia” comes from the Greek word for glue. Recent research is shedding light on the\\nmore complex role of neuroglia in the function of the brain and nervous system. Astrocyte cells, named for their\\ndistinctive star shape, are abundant in the central nervous system. The astrocytes have many functions, including\\nregulation of ion concentration in the intercellular space, uptake and/or breakdown of some neurotransmitters, and\\nformation of the blood-brain barrier, the membrane that separates the circulatory system from the brain. Microglia\\nprotect the nervous system against infection but are not nervous tissue because they are related to macrophages.\\nOligodendrocyte cells produce myelin in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) while the Schwann cell\\nproduces myelin in the peripheral nervous system (Figure 4.20).\\n150 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In the former case, understanding how tissues\\nrespond to damage can guide strategies to aid repair. In the latter case, understanding the impact of aging can help\\nin the search for ways to diminish its effects.\\nTissue Injury and Repair\\nInflammation is the standard, initial response of the body to injury. Whether biological, chemical, physical, or\\nradiation burns, all injuries lead to the same sequence of physiological events. Inflammation limits the extent of\\ninjury, partially or fully eliminates the cause of injury, and initiates repair and regeneration of damaged tissue.\\nNecrosis, or accidental cell death, causes inflammation. Apoptosis is programmed cell death, a normal step-by-\\nstep process that destroys cells no longer needed by the body. By mechanisms still under investigation, apoptosis\\ndoes not initiate the inflammatory response. Acute inflammation resolves over time by the healing of tissue. If\\ninflammation persists, it becomes chronic and leads to diseased conditions. Arthritis and tuberculosis are examples\\nof chronic inflammation. The suffix “-itis” denotes inflammation of a specific organ or type, for example, peritonitis\\nis the inflammation of the peritoneum, and meningitis refers to the inflammation of the meninges, the tough\\nmembranes that surround the central nervous system\\nThe four cardinal signs of inflammation—redness, swelling, pain, and local heat—were first recorded in antiquity.\\nCornelius Celsus is credited with documenting these signs during the days of the Roman Empire, as early as the first\\ncentury AD. A fifth sign, loss of function, may also accompany inflammation.\\nUpon tissue injury, damaged cells release inflammatory chemical signals that evoke local vasodilation, the widening\\nof the blood vessels. Increased blood flow results in apparent redness and heat. In response to injury, mast cells\\npresent in tissue degranulate, releasing the potent vasodilator histamine. Increased blood flow and inflammatory\\nmediators recruit white blood cells to the site of inflammation. The endothelium lining the local blood vessel\\nbecomes “leaky” under the influence of histamine and other inflammatory mediators allowing neutrophils,\\nmacrophages, and fluid to move from the blood into the interstitial tissue spaces. The excess liquid in tissue causes\\nswelling, more properly called edema. The swollen tissues squeezing pain receptors cause the sensation of pain.\\nProstaglandins released from injured cells also activate pain neurons. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\n(NSAIDs) reduce pain because they inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins. High levels of NSAIDs reduce\\ninflammation. Antihistamines decrease allergies by blocking histamine receptors and as a result the histamine\\n4.6 • Tissue Injury and Aging 151'),\n",

A scab forms when the clot dries, reducing the risk of infection.\\nSometimes a mixture of dead leukocytes and fluid called pus accumulates in the wound. As healing progresses,\\nfibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissues replace the collagen and extracellular material lost by the injury.\\nAngiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, results in vascularization of the new tissue known as granulation\\ntissue. The clot retracts pulling the edges of the wound together, and it slowly dissolves as the tissue is repaired.\\nWhen a large amount of granulation tissue forms and capillaries disappear, a pale scar is often visible in the healed\\narea. Aprimary union describes the healing of a wound where the edges are close together. When there is a gaping\\nwound, it takes longer to refill the area with cells and collagen. The process called secondary union occurs as the\\nedges of the wound are pulled together by what is called wound contraction. When a wound is more than one\\nquarter of an inch deep, sutures (stitches) are recommended to promote a primary union and avoid the formation of\\na disfiguring scar. Regeneration is the addition of new cells of the same type as the ones that were injured (\\nFigure\\n4.21).\\nFIGURE 4.21 Tissue Healing During wound repair, collagen fibers are laid down randomly by fibroblasts that move into repair the area.\\nINTERACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http:/ /openstax.org/l/healingskin) to see the skin healing process.

All the cells, tissues, and organs are affected by senescence, with noticeable variability\\nbetween individuals owing to different genetic makeup and lifestyles. The outward signs of aging are easily\\nrecognizable. The skin and other tissues become thinner and drier, reducing their elasticity, contributing to wrinkles\\nand high blood pressure. Hair turns gray because follicles produce less melanin, the brown pigment of hair and the\\niris of the eye. The face looks flabby because elastic and collagen fibers decrease in connective tissue and muscle\\ntone is lost. Glasses and hearing aids may become parts of life as the senses slowly deteriorate, all due to reduced\\nelasticity. Overall height decreases as the bones lose calcium and other minerals. With age, fluid decreases in the\\nfibrous cartilage disks intercalated between the vertebrae in the spine. Joints lose cartilage and stiffen. Many\\ntissues, including those in muscles, lose mass through a process calledatrophy. Lumps and rigidity become more\\nwidespread. As a consequence, the passageways, blood vessels, and airways become more rigid. The brain and\\nspinal cord lose mass. Nerves do not transmit impulses with the same speed and frequency as in the past. Some\\nloss of thought clarity and memory can accompany aging. More severe problems are not necessarily associated with\\nthe aging process and may be symptoms of underlying illness.\\n152 4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Telomeres, regions of\\nthe chromosomes necessary for cell division, shorten each time cells divide. As they do, cells are less able to divide\\nand regenerate. Because of alterations in cell membranes, transport of oxygen and nutrients into the cell and\\nremoval of carbon dioxide and waste products from the cell are not as efficient in the elderly.

Epigenetic modifications, changes that do not\\naffect the code of the DNA but alter how the DNA is decoded, are also known to generate abnormal cells. Alterations\\nin the genetic material may be caused by environmental agents, infectious agents, or errors in the replication of DNA\\nthat accumulate with age. Many mutations do not cause any noticeable change in the functions of a cell. However, if\\nthe modification affects key proteins that have an impact on the cell’s ability to proliferate in an orderly fashion, the\\ncell starts to divide abnormally. As changes in cells accumulate, they lose their ability to form regular tissues. A\\ntumor, a mass of cells displaying abnormal architecture, forms in the tissue. Many tumors are benign, meaning they\\ndo not metastasize nor cause disease. A tumor becomes malignant, or cancerous, when it breaches the confines of\\nits tissue, promotes angiogenesis, attracts the growth of capillaries, and metastasizes to other organs (Figure 4.22).\\nThe specific names of cancers reflect the tissue of origin. Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as\\ncarcinomas. Cancer in myeloid tissue or blood cells form myelomas.

Epithelial\\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\\ninformation.\\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\\nskin.\\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\\nstream. Glands are classified both according to the\\ntype of secretion and by their structure. Merocrine\\nglands secrete products as they are synthesized.\\nApocrine glands release secretions by pinching off the\\napical portion of the cell, whereas holocrine gland cells\\nstore their secretions until they rupture and release\\ntheir contents. In this case, the cell becomes part of\\nthe secretion.\\n4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and\\nProtects\\nConnective tissue is a heterogeneous tissue with many\\ncell shapes and tissue architecture. Structurally, all\\nconnective tissues contain cells that are embedded in\\nan extracellular matrix stabilized by proteins. The\\nchemical nature and physical layout of the extracellular\\nmatrix and proteins vary enormously among tissues,\\nreflecting the variety of functions that connective\\ntissue fulfills in the body. Connective tissues separate\\nand cushion organs, protecting them from shifting or\\ntraumatic injury. Connect tissues provide support and\\nassist movement, store and transport energy\\nmolecules, protect against infections, and contribute to\\ntemperature homeostasis.\\nMany different cells contribute to the formation of\\nconnective tissues. They originate in the mesodermal\\ngerm layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and\\nhematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow. Fibroblasts\\n4 • Chapter Review 157'),\n",

The extracellular matrix\\ncontains fluid, proteins, polysaccharide derivatives,\\nand, in the case of bone, mineral crystals. Protein fibers\\nfall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are\\nthick, strong, flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers\\nthat are thin and form a supportive mesh; and elastin\\nfibers that are thin and elastic.\\nThe major types of connective tissue are connective\\ntissue proper, supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose\\nconnective tissue proper includes adipose tissue,\\nareolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These serve to hold\\norgans and other tissues in place and, in the case of\\nadipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The\\nmatrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue\\nalthough adipose tissue does not have much\\nextracellular matrix. Dense connective tissue proper is\\nricher in fibers and may be regular, with fibers oriented\\nin parallel as in ligaments and tendons, or irregular,\\nwith fibers oriented in several directions. Organ\\ncapsules (collagenous type) and walls of arteries\\n(elastic type) contain dense irregular connective tissue.\\nCartilage and bone are supportive tissue. Cartilage\\ncontains chondrocytes and is somewhat flexible.\\nHyaline cartilage is smooth and clear, covers joints, and\\nis found in the growing portion of bones. Fibrocartilage\\nis tough because of extra collagen fibers and forms,\\namong other things, the intervertebral discs. Elastic\\ncartilage can stretch and recoil to its original shape\\nbecause of its high content of elastic fibers. The matrix\\ncontains very few blood vessels. Bones are made of a\\nrigid, mineralized matrix containing calcium salts,\\ncrystals, and osteocytes lodged in lacunae. Bone tissue\\nis highly vascularized. Cancellous bone is spongy and\\nless solid than compact bone. Fluid tissue, for example\\nblood and lymph, is characterized by a liquid matrix\\nand no supporting fibers.\\n4.4 Muscle Tissue and Motion\\nThe three types of muscle cells are skeletal, cardiac,\\nand smooth. Their morphologies match their specific\\nfunctions in the body. Skeletal muscle is voluntary and\\nresponds to conscious stimuli. The cells are striated\\nand multinucleated appearing as long, unbranched\\ncylinders. Cardiac muscle is involuntary and found only\\nin the heart. Each cell is striated with a single nucleus\\nand they attach to one another to form long fibers.\\nCells are attached to one another at intercalated disks.\\nThe cells are interconnected physically and\\nelectrochemically to act as a syncytium. Cardiac\\nmuscle cells contract autonomously and involuntarily.\\nSmooth muscle is involuntary. Each cell is a spindle-\\nshaped fiber and contains a single nucleus. No\\nstriations are evident because the actin and myosin\\nfilaments do not align in the cytoplasm.\\n4.5 Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception\\nand Response\\nThe most prominent cell of the nervous tissue, the\\nneuron, is characterized mainly by its ability to receive\\nstimuli and respond by generating an electrical signal,\\nknown as an action potential, which can travel rapidly\\nover great distances in the body. A typical neuron\\ndisplays a distinctive morphology: a large cell body\\nbranches out into short extensions called dendrites,\\nwhich receive chemical signals from other neurons,\\nand a long tail called an axon, which relays signals\\naway from the cell to other neurons, muscles, or\\nglands. Many axons are wrapped by a myelin sheath, a\\nlipid derivative that acts as an insulator and speeds up\\nthe transmission of the action potential. Other cells in\\nthe nervous tissue, the neuroglia, include the\\nastrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and Schwann\\ncells.\\n4.6 Tissue Injury and Aging\\nInflammation is the classic response of the body to\\ninjury and follows a common sequence of events. The\\narea is red, feels warm to the touch, swells, and is\\npainful. Injured cells, mast cells, and resident\\nmacrophages release chemical signals that cause\\nvasodilation and fluid leakage in the surrounding\\ntissue. The repair phase includes blood clotting,\\nfollowed by regeneration of tissue as fibroblasts\\ndeposit collagen. Some tissues regenerate more\\nreadily than others. Epithelial and connective tissues\\nreplace damaged or dead cells from a supply of adult\\nstem cells. Muscle and nervous tissues undergo either\\nslow regeneration or do not repair at all.\\nAge affects all the tissues and organs of the body.\\nDamaged cells do not regenerate as rapidly as in\\nyounger people. Perception of sensation and\\neffectiveness of response are lost in the nervous\\nsystem. Muscles atrophy, and bones lose mass and\\nbecome brittle. Collagen decreases in some connective\\ntissue, and joints stiffen.\\n158 4 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The integumentary system refers to the\\nskin and its accessory structures, and it is responsible for much more than simply lending to your outward\\nappearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5\\nto 2 m2. In fact, the skin and accessory structures are the largest organ system in the human body. As such, the skin\\nprotects your inner organs and it is in need of daily care and protection to maintain its health.

The skin and its accessory structures make up the\\nintegumentary system, which provides the body with overall protection. The skin is made of multiple layers of cells\\nand tissues, which are held to underlying structures by connective tissue (Figure 5.2).

What are the basic functions of each of these layers?\\nThe Epidermis\\nThe epidermis is composed of keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. It is made of four or five layers of\\nepithelial cells, depending on its location in the body. It does not have any blood vessels within it (i.e., it is\\navascular). Skin that has four layers of cells is referred to as “thin skin.” From deep to superficial, these layers are\\nthe stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. Most of the skin can be\\nclassified as thin skin. “Thick skin” is found only on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. It has a fifth\\nlayer, called the stratum lucidum, located between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum (Figure 5.3).\\nFIGURE 5.3 Thin Skin versus Thick Skin These slides show cross-sections of the epidermis and dermis of (a) thin and (b) thick skin.\\nNote the significant difference in the thickness of the epithelial layer of the thick skin.

A keratinocyte is a cell that\\nmanufactures and stores the protein keratin. Keratin is an intracellular fibrous protein that gives hair, nails, and skin\\ntheir hardness and water-resistant properties. The keratinocytes in the stratum corneum are dead and regularly\\nslough away, being replaced by cells from the deeper layers (Figure 5.4).\\n164 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The cells in the stratum basale bond to the\\ndermis via intertwining collagen fibers, referred to as the basement membrane. A finger-like projection, or fold,\\nknown as the dermal papilla (plural = dermal papillae) is found in the superficial portion of the dermis. Dermal\\npapillae increase the strength of the connection between the epidermis and dermis; the greater the folding, the\\nstronger the connections made (Figure 5.5).\\nFIGURE 5.5 Layers of the Epidermis The epidermis of thick skin has five layers: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum\\ngranulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum.\\nThe stratum basale is a single layer of cells primarily made of basal cells.

All of the keratinocytes are produced from this single layer\\nof cells, which are constantly going through mitosis to produce new cells. As new cells are formed, the existing cells\\nare pushed superficially away from the stratum basale. Two other cell types are found dispersed among the basal\\ncells in the stratum basale. The first is a Merkel cell, which functions as a receptor and is responsible for stimulating\\nsensory nerves that the brain perceives as touch. These cells are especially abundant on the surfaces of the hands\\nand feet. The second is a melanocyte, a cell that produces the pigment melanin. Melanin gives hair and skin its\\ncolor, and also helps protect the living cells of the epidermis from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage.\\nIn a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\\nStratum Spinosum\\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome. The desmosomes interlock with each other and strengthen the bond\\nbetween the cells. It is interesting to note that the “spiny” nature of this layer is an artifact of the staining process.\\nUnstained epidermis samples do not exhibit this characteristic appearance. The stratum spinosum is composed of\\neight to 10 layers of keratinocytes, formed as a result of cell division in the stratum basale (Figure 5.6). Interspersed\\namong the keratinocytes of this layer is a type of dendritic cell called the Langerhans cell, which functions as a\\nmacrophage by engulfing bacteria, foreign particles, and damaged cells that occur in this layer.\\nFIGURE 5.6 Cells of the Epidermis The cells in the different layers of the epidermis originate from basal cells located in the stratum\\nbasale, yet the cells of each layer are distinctively different.

As new keratinocytes are\\nproduced atop the stratum basale, the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum are pushed into the stratum\\ngranulosum.\\nStratum Granulosum\\nThe stratum granulosum has a grainy appearance due to further changes to the keratinocytes as they are pushed\\nfrom the stratum spinosum. The cells (three to five layers deep) become flatter, their cell membranes thicken, and\\nthey generate large amounts of the proteins keratin, which is fibrous, and keratohyalin, which accumulates as\\nlamellar granules within the cells (see Figure 5.5). These two proteins make up the bulk of the keratinocyte mass in\\nthe stratum granulosum and give the layer its grainy appearance. The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as\\nthe cells die, leaving behind the keratin, keratohyalin, and cell membranes that will form the stratum lucidum, the\\nstratum corneum, and the accessory structures of hair and nails.\\nStratum Lucidum\\nThe stratum lucidum is a smooth, seemingly translucent layer of the epidermis located just above the stratum\\ngranulosum and below the stratum corneum. This thin layer of cells is found only in the thick skin of the palms,\\nsoles, and digits. The keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (see Figure 5.5).\\nThese cells are densely packed with eleidin, a clear protein, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their\\ntransparent (i.e., lucid) appearance.\\nStratum Corneum\\nThe stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside\\nenvironment (see Figure 5.5). The increased keratinization (also called cornification) of the cells in this layer gives it\\nits name. There are usually 15 to 30 layers of cells in the stratum corneum. This dry, dead layer helps prevent the\\npenetration of microbes and the dehydration of underlying tissues, and provides a mechanical protection against\\nabrasion for the more delicate, underlying layers. Cells in this layer are shed periodically and are replaced by cells\\npushed up from the stratum granulosum (or stratum lucidum in the case of the palms and soles of feet). The entire\\nlayer is replaced during a period of about 4 weeks. Cosmetic procedures, such as microdermabrasion, help remove\\nsome of the dry, upper layer and aim to keep the skin looking “fresh” and healthy.\\nDermis\\nThe dermis might be considered the “core” of the integumentary system (derma- = “skin”), as distinct from the\\nepidermis (epi- = “upon” or “over”) and hypodermis (hypo- = “below”). It contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves,\\nand other structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands. The dermis is made of two layers of connective tissue\\nthat compose an interconnected mesh of elastin and collagenous fibers, produced by fibroblasts (Figure 5.7).\\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin 167'),\n",

(credit: modification of work by “kilbad”/Wikimedia Commons)\\nPapillary Layer\\nThe papillary layer is made of loose, areolar connective tissue, which means the collagen and elastin fibers of this\\nlayer form a loose mesh. This superficial layer of the dermis projects into the stratum basale of the epidermis to\\nform finger-like dermal papillae (see Figure 5.7). Within the papillary layer are fibroblasts, a small number of fat\\ncells (adipocytes), and an abundance of small blood vessels. In addition, the papillary layer contains phagocytes,\\ndefensive cells that help fight bacteria or other infections that have breached the skin. This layer also contains\\nlymphatic capillaries, nerve fibers, and touch receptors called the Meissner corpuscles.\\nReticular Layer\\nUnderlying the papillary layer is the much thicker reticular layer, composed of dense, irregular connective tissue.\\nThis layer is well vascularized and has a rich sensory and sympathetic nerve supply. The reticular layer appears\\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.\\nHypodermis\\nThe hypodermis (also called the subcutaneous layer or superficial fascia) is a layer directly below the dermis and\\nserves to connect the skin to the underlying fascia (fibrous tissue) of the bones and muscles. It is not strictly a part\\nof the skin, although the border between the hypodermis and dermis can be difficult to distinguish. The hypodermis\\nconsists of well-vascularized, loose, areolar connective tissue and adipose tissue, which functions as a mode of fat\\nstorage and provides insulation and cushioning for the integument.\\n168 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat\\ncan serve as an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying\\nstructures from trauma.\\nWhere the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone,\\nestrogen, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors. Fat distribution changes as our bodies\\nmature and age. Males tend to accumulate fat in different areas (neck, arms, lower back, and abdomen) than do\\nfemales (breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks). The body mass index (BMI) is often used as a measure of fat,\\nalthough this measure is, in fact, derived from a mathematical formula that compares body weight (mass) to\\nheight.

Not only is this a problem for the individuals affected, but it also has a severe impact on our healthcare\\nsystem.

Eumelanin exists as black and brown, whereas pheomelanin provides a red\\ncolor. Dark-skinned individuals produce more melanin than those with pale skin. Exposure to the UV rays of the sun\\nor a tanning salon causes melanin to be manufactured and built up in keratinocytes, as sun exposure stimulates\\nkeratinocytes to secrete chemicals that stimulate melanocytes. The accumulation of melanin in keratinocytes\\nresults in the darkening of the skin, or a tan. This increased melanin accumulation protects the DNA of epidermal\\ncells from UV ray damage and the breakdown of folic acid, a nutrient necessary for our health and well-being. In\\ncontrast, too much melanin can interfere with the production of vitamin D, an important nutrient involved in calcium\\nabsorption. Thus, the amount of melanin present in our skin is dependent on a balance between available sunlight\\nand folic acid destruction, and protection from UV radiation and vitamin D production.\\nIt requires about 10 days after initial sun exposure for melanin synthesis to peak, which is why pale-skinned\\nindividuals tend to suffer sunburns of the epidermis initially. Dark-skinned individuals can also get sunburns, but are\\nmore protected than are pale-skinned individuals. Melanosomes are temporary structures that are eventually\\ndestroyed by fusion with lysosomes; this fact, along with melanin-filled keratinocytes in the stratum corneum\\nsloughing off, makes tanning impermanent.\\nToo much sun exposure can eventually lead to wrinkling due to the destruction of the cellular structure of the skin,\\nand in severe cases, can cause sufficient DNA damage to result in skin cancer.

Most skin disorders are relatively benign, but a few, including melanomas, can be fatal if\\nuntreated. A couple of the more noticeable disorders, albinism and vitiligo, affect the appearance of the skin and\\nits accessory organs. Although neither is fatal, it would be hard to claim that they are benign, at least to the\\nindividuals so afflicted.\\nAlbinism is a genetic disorder that affects (completely or partially) the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes. The\\ndefect is primarily due to the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin. Individuals with albinism tend to\\nappear white or very pale due to the lack of melanin in their skin and hair. Recall that melanin helps protect the\\nskin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with albinism tend to need more protection from UV\\nradiation, as they are more prone to sunburns and skin cancer. They also tend to be more sensitive to light and\\nhave vision problems due to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall. Treatment of this disorder usually\\ninvolves addressing the symptoms, such as limiting UV light exposure to the skin and eyes. In vitiligo, the\\nmelanocytes in certain areas lose their ability to produce melanin, possibly due to an autoimmune reaction. This\\nleads to a loss of color in patches (Figure 5.10). Neither albinism nor vitiligo directly affects the lifespan of an\\nindividual.\\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin 171'),\n",

These structures\\nembryologically originate from the epidermis and can extend down through the dermis into the hypodermis.\\nHair\\nHair is a keratinous filament growing out of the epidermis. It is primarily made of dead, keratinized cells. Strands of\\nhair originate in an epidermal penetration of the dermis called the hair follicle. The hair shaft is the part of the hair\\nnot anchored to the follicle, and much of this is exposed at the skin’s surface. The rest of the hair, which is anchored\\nin the follicle, lies below the surface of the skin and is referred to as the hair root. The hair root ends deep in the\\ndermis at the hair bulb, and includes a layer of mitotically active basal cells called the hair matrix. The hair bulb\\nsurrounds the hair papilla, which is made of connective tissue and contains blood capillaries and nerve endings\\nfrom the dermis (Figure 5.11).\\nFIGURE 5.10 Vitiligo Individuals with vitiligo experience depigmentation that results in lighter colored patches of skin. The\\ncondition is especially noticeable on darker skin. (credit: (a) Klaus D. Peter (b) Owl Bridge Media / Wikimedia.)\\nOther changes in the appearance of skin coloration can be indicative of diseases associated with other body\\nsystems. Liver disease or liver cancer can cause the accumulation of bile and the yellow pigment bilirubin,\\nleading to the skin appearing yellow or jaundiced (jaune is the French word for “yellow”). Tumors of the pituitary\\ngland can result in the secretion of large amounts of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which results in a\\ndarkening of the skin. Similarly, Addison’s disease can stimulate the release of excess amounts of\\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which can give the skin a deep bronze color. A sudden drop in oxygenation\\ncan affect skin color, causing the skin to initially turn ashen (white). With a prolonged reduction in oxygen levels,\\ndark red deoxyhemoglobin becomes dominant in the blood, making the skin appear blue, a condition referred to\\nas cyanosis (kyanos is the Greek word for “blue”). This happens when the oxygen supply is restricted, as when\\nsomeone is experiencing difficulty in breathing because of asthma or a heart attack. However, in these cases the\\neffect on skin color has nothing do with the skin’s pigmentation.\\n172 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

For\\nexample, hair on the head protects the skull from the sun. The hair in the nose and ears, and around the eyes\\n(eyelashes) defends the body by trapping and excluding dust particles that may contain allergens and microbes.\\nHair of the eyebrows prevents sweat and other particles from dripping into and bothering the eyes. Hair also has a\\nsensory function due to sensory innervation by a hair root plexus surrounding the base of each hair follicle. Hair is\\nextremely sensitive to air movement or other disturbances in the environment, much more so than the skin surface.\\nThis feature is also useful for the detection of the presence of insects or other potentially damaging substances on\\nthe skin surface. Each hair root is connected to a smooth muscle called the arrector pili that contracts in response\\nto nerve signals from the sympathetic nervous system, making the external hair shaft “stand up.” The primary\\npurpose for this is to trap a layer of air to add insulation. This is visible in humans as goose bumps and even more\\nobvious in animals, such as when a frightened cat raises its fur. Of course, this is much more obvious in organisms\\nwith a heavier coat than most humans, such as dogs and cats.\\nHair Growth\\nHair grows and is eventually shed and replaced by new hair. This occurs in three phases. The first is the anagen\\nphase, during which cells divide rapidly at the root of the hair, pushing the hair shaft up and out. The length of this\\nphase is measured in years, typically from 2 to 7 years. The catagen phase lasts only 2 to 3 weeks, and marks a\\ntransition from the hair follicle’s active growth. Finally, during the telogen phase, the hair follicle is at rest and no\\nnew growth occurs. At the end of this phase, which lasts about 2 to 4 months, another anagen phase begins. The\\nbasal cells in the hair matrix then produce a new hair follicle, which pushes the old hair out as the growth cycle\\nrepeats itself. Hair typically grows at the rate of 0.3 mm per day during the anagen phase. On average, 50 hairs are\\nlost and replaced per day. Hair loss occurs if there is more hair shed than what is replaced and can happen due to\\nhormonal or dietary changes. Hair loss can also result from the aging process, or the influence of hormones.\\n174 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\\nsurface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly\\nof water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine\\nglands are a primary component of thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis.\\nFIGURE 5.14 Eccrine Gland Eccrine glands are coiled glands in the dermis that release sweat that is mostly water.\\nAn apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital\\nregions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even\\nreaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts,\\napocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition\\nand subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the\\npoorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based\\ncompound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat.

Most sebaceous glands are associated with hair follicles. They generate and excrete sebum, a mixture\\nof lipids, onto the skin surface, thereby naturally lubricating the dry and dead layer of keratinized cells of the stratum\\ncorneum, keeping it pliable. The fatty acids of sebum also have antibacterial properties, and prevent water loss from\\nthe skin in low-humidity environments.

The hair root\\nplexus surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the\\ncentral nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can then respond by activating the skeletal muscles of your\\neyes to see the ant and the skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.\\nThe skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory\\nnerve structures that detect touch, surface temperature, and pain. These receptors are more concentrated on the\\ntips of the fingers, which are most sensitive to touch, especially the Meissner corpuscle (tactile corpuscle) (Figure\\n5.15), which responds to light touch, and the Pacinian corpuscle (lamellated corpuscle), which responds to\\nEveryday Connection\\nTattoos and Piercings\\nThe word “armor” evokes several images. You might think of a Roman centurion or a medieval knight in a suit of\\narmor. The skin, in its own way, functions as a form of armor—body armor. It provides a barrier between your\\nvital, life-sustaining organs and the influence of outside elements that could potentially damage them.\\nFor any form of armor, a breach in the protective barrier poses a danger. The skin can be breached when a child\\nskins a knee or an adult has blood drawn—one is accidental and the other medically necessary. However, you\\nalso breach this barrier when you choose to “accessorize” your skin with a tattoo or body piercing. Because the\\nneedles involved in producing body art and piercings must penetrate the skin, there are dangers associated with\\nthe practice. These include allergic reactions; skin infections; blood-borne diseases, such as tetanus, hepatitis\\nC, and hepatitis D; and the growth of scar tissue. Despite the risk, the practice of piercing the skin for decorative\\npurposes has become increasingly popular. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 24 percent of\\npeople from ages 18 to 50 have a tattoo.\\n5.3 • Functions of the Integumentary System 177'),\n",

Merkel cells, seen scattered in the stratum basale, are also touch receptors. In addition to these\\nspecialized receptors, there are sensory nerves connected to each hair follicle, pain and temperature receptors\\nscattered throughout the skin, and motor nerves innervate the arrector pili muscles and glands. This rich innervation\\nhelps us sense our environment and react accordingly.\\nFIGURE 5.15 Light Micrograph of a Meissner Corpuscle In this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a Meissner corpuscle\\n(arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying\\nepidermis.

(credit: “Wbensmith”/Wikimedia Commons)\\nThermoregulation\\nThe integumentary system helps regulate body temperature through its tight association with the sympathetic\\nnervous system, the division of the nervous system involved in our fight-or-flight responses. The sympathetic\\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people\\nexperience when exercising.\\n178 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Among these\\nchanges are reductions in cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation, hormonal levels, and muscle\\nstrength (Figure 5.17). In the skin, these changes are reflected in decreased mitosis in the stratum basale,\\nleading to a thinner epidermis. The dermis, which is responsible for the elasticity and resilience of the skin,\\nexhibits a reduced ability to regenerate, which leads to slower wound healing. The hypodermis, with its fat\\nstores, loses structure due to the reduction and redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning\\nand sagging of skin.\\nFIGURE 5.17 Aging Generally, skin, especially on the face and hands, starts to display the first noticeable signs of aging, as it loses\\nits elasticity over time.

In the presence of\\nsunlight, a form of vitamin D3 called cholecalciferol is synthesized from a derivative of the steroid cholesterol in the\\nskin. The liver converts cholecalciferol to calcidiol, which is then converted to calcitriol (the active chemical form of\\nthe vitamin) in the kidneys. Vitamin D is essential for normal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, which are\\nrequired for healthy bones. The absence of sun exposure can lead to a lack of vitamin D in the body, leading to a\\ncondition called rickets, a painful condition in children where the bones are misshapen due to a lack of calcium,\\ncausing bowleggedness. Elderly individuals who suffer from vitamin D deficiency can develop a condition called\\nosteomalacia, a softening of the bones. In present day society, vitamin D is added as a supplement to many foods,\\nincluding milk and orange juice, compensating for the need for sun exposure.\\nIn addition to its essential role in bone health, vitamin D is essential for general immunity against bacterial, viral,\\nand fungal infections. Recent studies are also finding a link between insufficient vitamin D and cancer.\\n5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe several different diseases and disorders of the skin\\n• Describe the effect of injury to the skin and the process of healing\\nThe integumentary system is susceptible to a variety of diseases, disorders, and injuries. These range from annoying\\nbut relatively benign bacterial or fungal infections that are categorized as disorders, to skin cancer and severe burns,\\nwhich can be fatal. In this section, you will learn several of the most common skin conditions.\\nDiseases\\nOne of the most talked about diseases is skin cancer. Cancer is a broad term that describes diseases caused by\\nabnormal cells in the body dividing uncontrollably. Most cancers are identified by the organ or tissue in which the\\ncancer originates. One common form of cancer is skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that one in five\\nAmericans will experience some type of skin cancer in their lifetime. The degradation of the ozone layer in the\\natmosphere and the resulting increase in exposure to UV radiation has contributed to its rise. Overexposure to UV\\nradiation damages DNA, which can lead to the formation of cancerous lesions. Although melanin offers some\\nprotection against DNA damage from the sun, often it is not enough. The fact that cancers can also occur on areas of\\nthe body that are normally not exposed to UV radiation suggests that there are additional factors that can lead to\\ncancerous lesions.\\nIn general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These mutations can result in cell populations\\nthat do not die when they should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors. Although many tumors are\\nbenign (harmless), some produce cells that can mobilize and establish tumors in other organs of the body; this\\nprocess is referred to as metastasis. Cancers are characterized by their ability to metastasize.\\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\\nBasal cell carcinoma is a form of cancer that affects the mitotically active stem cells in the stratum basale of the\\nThe accessory structures also have lowered activity, generating thinner hair and nails, and reduced amounts of\\nsebum and sweat. A reduced sweating ability can cause some elderly to be intolerant to extreme heat. Other\\ncells in the skin, such as melanocytes and dendritic cells, also become less active, leading to a paler skin tone\\nand lowered immunity. Wrinkling of the skin occurs due to breakdown of its structure, which results from\\ndecreased collagen and elastin production in the dermis, weakening of muscles lying under the skin, and the\\ninability of the skin to retain adequate moisture.\\nMany anti-aging products can be found in stores today. In general, these products try to rehydrate the skin and\\nthereby fill out the wrinkles, and some stimulate skin growth using hormones and growth factors. Additionally,\\ninvasive techniques include collagen injections to plump the tissue and injections of BOTOX® (the name brand of\\nthe botulinum neurotoxin) that paralyze the muscles that crease the skin and cause wrinkling.\\n180 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

It is the most common of all cancers that occur in the United States and is frequently found on the head,\\nneck, arms, and back, which are areas that are most susceptible to long-term sun exposure. Although UV rays are\\nthe main culprit, exposure to other agents, such as radiation and arsenic, can also lead to this type of cancer.\\nWounds on the skin due to open sores, tattoos, burns, etc. may be predisposing factors as well. Basal cell\\ncarcinomas start in the stratum basale and usually spread along this boundary. At some point, they begin to grow\\ntoward the surface and become an uneven patch, bump, growth, or scar on the skin surface (Figure 5.18). Like most\\ncancers, basal cell carcinomas respond best to treatment when caught early. Treatment options include surgery,\\nfreezing (cryosurgery), and topical ointments (Mayo Clinic 2012).\\nFIGURE 5.18 Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma can take several different forms. Similar to other forms of skin cancer, it is\\nreadily cured if caught early and treated. (credit: John Hendrix, MD)\\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma\\nSquamous cell carcinoma is a cancer that affects the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum and presents as\\nlesions commonly found on the scalp, ears, and hands (Figure 5.19). It is the second most common skin cancer. The\\nAmerican Cancer Society reports that two of 10 skin cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, and it is more\\naggressive than basal cell carcinoma. If not removed, these carcinomas can metastasize. Surgery and radiation are\\nused to cure squamous cell carcinoma.\\nFIGURE 5.19 Squamous Cell Carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma presents here as a lesion on an individual’s nose. (credit: the\\nNational Cancer Institute)\\nMelanoma\\nA melanoma is a cancer characterized by the uncontrolled growth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in\\nthe epidermis. Typically, a melanoma develops from a mole. It is the most fatal of all skin cancers, as it is highly\\nmetastatic and can be difficult to detect before it has spread to other organs. Melanomas usually appear as\\nasymmetrical brown and black patches with uneven borders and a raised surface (Figure 5.20). Treatment typically\\ninvolves surgical excision and immunotherapy.\\nFIGURE 5.20 Melanoma Melanomas typically present as large brown or black patches with uneven borders and a raised surface.\\n5.4 • Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System 181'),\n",

Eczema is an inflammatory condition and occurs in individuals of\\nall ages. Acne involves the clogging of pores, which can lead to infection and inflammation, and is often seen in\\nadolescents. Other disorders, not discussed here, include seborrheic dermatitis (on the scalp), psoriasis, cold sores,\\nimpetigo, scabies, hives, and warts.\\nEczema\\nEczema is an allergic reaction that manifests as dry, itchy patches of skin that resemble rashes (Figure 5.21). It may\\nbe accompanied by swelling of the skin, flaking, and in severe cases, bleeding. Many who suffer from eczema have\\nantibodies against dust mites in their blood, but the link between eczema and allergy to dust mites has not been\\nproven. Symptoms are usually managed with moisturizers, corticosteroid creams, and immunosuppressants.\\nFIGURE 5.21 Eczema Eczema is a common skin disorder that presents as a red, flaky rash. (credit: “Jambula” Wikimedia Commons /\\nNIAID, Flickr)\\nAcne\\nAcne is a skin disturbance that typically occurs on areas of the skin that are rich in sebaceous glands (face and\\nback). It is most common along with the onset of puberty due to associated hormonal changes, but can also occur in\\ninfants and continue into adulthood. Hormones, such as androgens, stimulate the release of sebum. An\\noverproduction and accumulation of sebum along with keratin can block hair follicles. This plug is initially white. The\\nsebum, when oxidized by exposure to air, turns black. Acne results from infection by acne-causing bacteria\\n(Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus), which can lead to redness and potential scarring due to the natural wound\\nhealing process (Figure 5.22).\\n182 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Dermatologists help patients with these types of problems and more, on a daily basis. Dermatologists are\\nmedical doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating skin disorders. Like all medical doctors, dermatologists\\nearn a medical degree and then complete several years of residency training. In addition, dermatologists may then\\nparticipate in a dermatology fellowship or complete additional, specialized training in a dermatology practice. If\\npracticing in the United States, dermatologists must pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE),\\nbecome licensed in their state of practice, and be certified by the American Board of Dermatology.\\nMost dermatologists work in a medical office or private-practice setting. They diagnose skin conditions and rashes,\\nprescribe oral and topical medications to treat skin conditions, and may perform simple procedures, such as mole or\\nwart removal. In addition, they may refer patients to an oncologist if skin cancer that has metastasized is suspected.\\nRecently, cosmetic procedures have also become a prominent part of dermatology. Botox injections, laser\\ntreatments, and collagen and dermal filler injections are popular among patients, hoping to reduce the appearance\\nof skin aging.\\nDermatology is a competitive specialty in medicine. Limited openings in dermatology residency programs mean that\\nmany medical students compete for a few select spots. Dermatology is an appealing specialty to many prospective\\ndoctors, because unlike emergency room physicians or surgeons, dermatologists generally do not have to work\\nexcessive hours or be “on-call” weekends and holidays. Moreover, the popularity of cosmetic dermatology has made\\nit a growing field with many lucrative opportunities. It is not unusual for dermatology clinics to market themselves\\nexclusively as cosmetic dermatology centers, and for dermatologists to specialize exclusively in these procedures.\\nConsider visiting a dermatologist to talk about why they entered the field and what the field of dermatology is like.\\nVisit this site (http://www.Diplomaguide.com) for additional information.\\nInjuries\\nBecause the skin is the part of our bodies that meets the world most directly, it is especially vulnerable to injury.\\nInjuries include burns and wounds, as well as scars and calluses. They can be caused by sharp objects, heat, or\\nexcessive pressure or friction to the skin.\\nSkin injuries set off a healing process that occurs in several overlapping stages. The first step to repairing damaged\\nskin is the formation of a blood clot that helps stop the flow of blood and scabs over with time. Many different types\\nof cells are involved in wound repair, especially if the surface area that needs repair is extensive.

Blood capillaries follow the fibroblasts and help\\nincrease blood circulation and oxygen supply to the area. Immune cells, such as macrophages, roam the area and\\nengulf any foreign matter to reduce the chance of infection.\\nBurns\\nA burn results when the skin is damaged by intense heat, radiation, electricity, or chemicals. The damage results in\\nthe death of skin cells, which can lead to a massive loss of fluid. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and renal and\\ncirculatory failure follow, which can be fatal. Burn patients are treated with intravenous fluids to offset dehydration,\\nas well as intravenous nutrients that enable the body to repair tissues and replace lost proteins. Another serious\\nthreat to the lives of burn patients is infection. Burned skin is extremely susceptible to bacteria and other\\npathogens, due to the loss of protection by intact layers of skin.\\nBurns are sometimes measured in terms of the size of the total surface area affected. This is referred to as the “rule\\nof nines,” which associates specific anatomical areas with a percentage that is a factor of nine (Figure 5.23). Burns\\nare also classified by the degree of their severity. A first-degree burn is a superficial burn that affects only the\\nepidermis. Although the skin may be painful and swollen, these burns typically heal on their own within a few days.\\nMild sunburn fits into the category of a first-degree burn. A second-degree burn goes deeper and affects both the\\nepidermis and a portion of the dermis. These burns result in swelling and a painful blistering of the skin. It is\\nimportant to keep the burn site clean and sterile to prevent infection. If this is done, the burn will heal within several\\nweeks. A third-degree burn fully extends into the epidermis and dermis, destroying the tissue and affecting the\\nnerve endings and sensory function. These are serious burns that may appear white, red, or black; they require\\nmedical attention and will heal slowly without it. A fourth-degree burn is even more severe, affecting the underlying\\nmuscle and bone. Oddly, third and fourth-degree burns are usually not as painful because the nerve endings\\nthemselves are damaged. Full-thickness burns cannot be repaired by the body, because the local tissues used for\\nrepair are damaged and require excision (debridement), or amputation in severe cases, followed by grafting of the\\nskin from an unaffected part of the body, or from skin grown in tissue culture for grafting purposes.\\nFIGURE 5.23 Calculating the Size of a Burn The size of a burn will guide decisions made about the need for specialized treatment.\\nSpecific parts of the body are associated with a percentage of body area.\\n184 5 • The Integumentary System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Watch\\nthis video (http://openstax.org/l/skingraft) to learn more about skin grafting procedures.\\nScars and Keloids\\nMost cuts or wounds, with the exception of ones that only scratch the surface (the epidermis), lead to scar\\nformation. A scar is collagen-rich skin formed after the process of wound healing that differs from normal skin.\\nScarring occurs in cases in which there is repair of skin damage, but the skin fails to regenerate the original skin\\nstructure. Fibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of collagen, and the bulk of repair is due to the basket-weave\\npattern generated by collagen fibers and does not result in regeneration of the typical cellular structure of skin.\\nInstead, the tissue is fibrous in nature and does not allow for the regeneration of accessory structures, such as hair\\nfollicles, sweat glands, or sebaceous glands.\\nSometimes, there is an overproduction of scar tissue, because the process of collagen formation does not stop when\\nthe wound is healed; this results in the formation of a raised or hypertrophic scar called a keloid. In contrast, scars\\nthat result from acne and chickenpox have a sunken appearance and are called atrophic scars.\\nScarring of skin after wound healing is a natural process and does not need to be treated further. Application of\\nmineral oil and lotions may reduce the formation of scar tissue. However, modern cosmetic procedures, such as\\ndermabrasion, laser treatments, and filler injections have been invented as remedies for severe scarring. All of these\\nprocedures try to reorganize the structure of the epidermis and underlying collagen tissue to make it look more\\nnatural.\\nBedsores and Stretch Marks\\nSkin and its underlying tissue can be affected by excessive pressure. One example of this is called a bedsore.\\nBedsores, also called decubitis ulcers, are caused by constant, long-term, unrelieved pressure on certain body parts\\nthat are bony, reducing blood flow to the area and leading to necrosis (tissue death). Bedsores are most common in\\nelderly patients who have debilitating conditions that cause them to be immobile. Most hospitals and long-term care\\nfacilities have the practice of turning the patients every few hours to prevent the incidence of bedsores. If left\\nuntreated by removal of necrotized tissue, bedsores can be fatal if they become infected.\\nThe skin can also be affected by pressure associated with rapid growth. A stretch mark results when the dermis is\\nstretched beyond its limits of elasticity, as the skin stretches to accommodate the excess pressure. Stretch marks\\nusually accompany rapid weight gain during puberty and pregnancy. They initially have a reddish hue, but lighten\\nover time. Other than for cosmetic reasons, treatment of stretch marks is not required. They occur most commonly\\nover the hips and abdomen.\\nCalluses\\nWhen you wear shoes that do not fit well and are a constant source of abrasion on your toes, you tend to form a\\ncallus at the point of contact. This occurs because the basal stem cells in the stratum basale are triggered to divide\\nmore often to increase the thickness of the skin at the point of abrasion to protect the rest of the body from further\\ndamage. This is an example of a minor or local injury, and the skin manages to react and treat the problem\\nindependent of the rest of the body. Calluses can also form on your fingers if they are subject to constant\\nmechanical stress, such as long periods of writing, playing string instruments, or video games. A corn is a\\nspecialized form of callus. Corns form from abrasions on the skin that result from an elliptical-type motion.\\n5.4 • Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System 185'),\n",

The stratum basale also\\ncontains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the\\npigment primarily responsible for giving skin its color.\\nMelanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum\\nspinosum to protect cells from UV rays.\\nThe dermis connects the epidermis to the hypodermis,\\nand provides strength and elasticity due to the\\npresence of collagen and elastin fibers. It has only two\\nlayers: the papillary layer with papillae that extend into\\nthe epidermis and the lower, reticular layer composed\\nof loose connective tissue. The hypodermis, deep to\\nthe dermis of skin, is the connective tissue that\\nconnects the dermis to underlying structures; it also\\nharbors adipose tissue for fat storage and protection.\\n5.2 Accessory Structures of the Skin\\nAccessory structures of the skin include hair, nails,\\nsweat glands, and sebaceous glands.

It is\\nthe first layer of defense to prevent dehydration,\\ninfection, and injury to the rest of the body. Sweat\\nglands in the skin allow the skin surface to cool when\\nthe body gets overheated. Thermoregulation is also\\naccomplished by the dilation or constriction of heat-\\ncarrying blood vessels in the skin. Immune cells\\npresent among the skin layers patrol the areas to keep\\nthem free of foreign materials. Fat stores in the\\nhypodermis aid in both thermoregulation and\\nprotection. Finally, the skin plays a role in the synthesis\\nof vitamin D, which is necessary for our well-being but\\nnot easily available in natural foods.\\n5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the\\nIntegumentary System\\nSkin cancer is a result of damage to the DNA of skin\\ncells, often due to excessive exposure to UV radiation.\\nBasal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are\\nhighly curable, and arise from cells in the stratum\\nbasale and stratum spinosum, respectively. Melanoma\\nis the most dangerous form of skin cancer, affecting\\nmelanocytes, which can spread/metastasize to other\\norgans. Burns are an injury to the skin that occur as a\\nresult of exposure to extreme heat, radiation, or\\nchemicals. First-degree and second-degree burns\\nusually heal quickly, but third-degree burns can be\\nfatal because they penetrate the full thickness of the\\nskin. Scars occur when there is repair of skin damage.\\nFibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of collagen,\\nwhich forms a basket-weave pattern that looks\\ndifferent from normal skin.\\nBedsores and stretch marks are the result of excessive\\npressure on the skin and underlying tissue. Bedsores\\nare characterized by necrosis of tissue due to\\nimmobility, whereas stretch marks result from rapid\\ngrowth. Eczema is an allergic reaction that manifests as\\na rash, and acne results from clogged sebaceous\\nglands. Eczema and acne are usually long-term skin\\nconditions that may be treated successfully in mild\\ncases.

The\\nskeletal system is the body system composed of bones and cartilage and performs the following critical functions\\nfor the human body:\\nFigure 6.1 Child Looking at Bones Bone is a living tissue.

Simply by\\nlooking at a person, you can see how the bones support, facilitate movement, and protect the human body.\\nJust as the steel beams of a building provide a scaffold to support its weight, the bones and cartilage of your\\nskeletal system compose the scaffold that supports the rest of your body. Without the skeletal system, you would be\\na limp mass of organs, muscle, and skin.\\nBones also facilitate movement by serving as points of attachment for your muscles. While some bones only serve\\nas a support for the muscles, others also transmit the forces produced when your muscles contract. From a\\nmechanical point of view, bones act as levers and joints serve as fulcrums (Figure 6.2). Unless a muscle spans a\\njoint and contracts, a bone is not going to move. For information on the interaction of the skeletal and muscular\\nsystems, that is, the musculoskeletal system, seek additional content.\\nFIGURE 6.2 Bones Support Movement Bones act as levers when muscles span a joint and contract.

Lateral curvatures (scoliosis) can be severe enough to slip under the shoulder blade (scapula) forcing it up\\nas a hump. Spinal curvatures can also be excessive dorsoventrally (kyphosis) causing a hunch back and thoracic\\ncompression. These curvatures often appear in preteens as the result of poor posture, abnormal growth, or\\nindeterminate causes. Mostly, they are readily treated by orthopedists. As people age, accumulated spinal column\\ninjuries and diseases like osteoporosis can also lead to curvatures of the spine, hence the stooping you sometimes\\nsee in the elderly.\\nSome orthopedists sub-specialize in sports medicine, which addresses both simple injuries, such as a sprained\\nankle, and complex injuries, such as a torn rotator cuff in the shoulder. Treatment can range from exercise to\\nsurgery.\\nMineral Storage, Energy Storage, and Hematopoiesis\\nOn a metabolic level, bone tissue performs several critical functions. For one, the bone matrix acts as a reservoir for\\na number of minerals important to the functioning of the body, especially calcium, and phosphorus. These minerals,\\nincorporated into bone tissue, can be released back into the bloodstream to maintain levels needed to support\\nphysiological processes. Calcium ions, for example, are essential for muscle contractions and controlling the flow of\\nother ions involved in the transmission of nerve impulses.\\nBone also serves as a site for fat storage and blood cell production. The softer connective tissue that fills the interior\\nof most bone is referred to as bone marrow (Figure 6.5). There are two types of bone marrow: yellow marrow and\\nred marrow. Yellow marrow contains adipose tissue; the triglycerides stored in the adipocytes of the tissue can\\nserve as a source of energy. Red marrow is where hematopoiesis—the production of blood cells—takes place. Red\\nblood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are all produced in the red marrow.\\nFIGURE 6.5 Head of Femur Showing Red and Yellow Marrow The head of the femur contains both yellow and red marrow.

A long bone\\nhas two parts: the diaphysis and the epiphysis. The diaphysis is the tubular shaft that runs between the proximal\\nand distal ends of the bone. The hollow region in the diaphysis is called the medullary cavity, which is filled with\\nyellow marrow. The walls of the diaphysis are composed of dense and hard compact bone.\\nFIGURE 6.7 Anatomy of a Long Bone A typical long bone shows the gross anatomical characteristics of bone.\\nThe wider section at each end of the bone is called the epiphysis (plural = epiphyses), which is filled with spongy\\nbone. Red marrow fills the spaces in the spongy bone. Each epiphysis meets the diaphysis at the metaphysis, the\\nnarrow area that contains the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), a layer of hyaline (transparent) cartilage in a growing\\nbone. When the bone stops growing in early adulthood (approximately 18–21 years), the cartilage is replaced by\\nosseous tissue and the epiphyseal plate becomes an epiphyseal line.\\nThe medullary cavity has a delicate membranous lining called the endosteum (end- = “inside”; oste- = “bone”),\\nwhere bone growth, repair, and remodeling occur. The outer surface of the bone is covered with a fibrous membrane\\ncalled the periosteum (peri- = “around” or “surrounding”). The periosteum contains blood vessels, nerves, and\\nlymphatic vessels that nourish compact bone. Tendons and ligaments also attach to bones at the periosteum. The\\n6.3 • Bone Structure 197'),\n",

The two layers of compact bone and the interior spongy bone work together to protect\\nthe internal organs. If the outer layer of a cranial bone fractures, the brain is still protected by the intact inner layer.\\nFIGURE 6.9 Anatomy of a Flat Bone This cross-section of a flat bone shows the spongy bone (diploë) lined on either side by a layer of\\ncompact bone.\\nBone Markings\\nThe surface features of bones vary considerably, depending on the function and location in the body. Table 6.2\\ndescribes the bone markings, which are illustrated in (Figure 6.10). There are three general classes of bone\\nmarkings: (1) articulations, (2) projections, and (3) holes. As the name implies, an articulation is where two bone\\nsurfaces come together (articulus = “joint”). These surfaces tend to conform to one another, such as one being\\nrounded and the other cupped, to facilitate the function of the articulation. A projection is an area of a bone that\\nprojects above the surface of the bone. These are the attachment points for tendons and ligaments. In general, their\\nsize and shape is an indication of the forces exerted through the attachment to the bone. A hole is an opening or\\ngroove in the bone that allows blood vessels and nerves to enter the bone. As with the other markings, their size and\\nshape reflect the size of the vessels and nerves that penetrate the bone at these points.\\n198 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These salt crystals form when calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate combine\\nto create hydroxyapatite, which incorporates other inorganic salts like magnesium hydroxide, fluoride, and sulfate as\\nit crystallizes, or calcifies, on the collagen fibers. The hydroxyapatite crystals give bones their hardness and\\nstrength, while the collagen fibers give them flexibility so that they are not brittle.\\nAlthough bone cells compose a small amount of the bone volume, they are crucial to the function of bones. Four\\ntypes of cells are found within bone tissue: osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteogenic cells, and osteoclasts (Figure 6.11).\\n200 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Osteogenic cells are undifferentiated and develop into\\nosteoblasts. When osteoblasts get trapped within the calcified matrix, their structure and function changes, and they become osteocytes.\\nOsteoclasts develop from monocytes and macrophages and differ in appearance from other bone cells.\\nThe osteoblast is the bone cell responsible for forming new bone and is found in the growing portions of bone,\\nincluding the periosteum and endosteum. Osteoblasts, which do not divide, synthesize and secrete the collagen\\nmatrix and calcium salts. As the secreted matrix surrounding the osteoblast calcifies, the osteoblast become\\ntrapped within it; as a result, it changes in structure and becomes an osteocyte, the primary cell of mature bone and\\nthe most common type of bone cell. Each osteocyte is located in a space called a lacuna and is surrounded by bone\\ntissue. Osteocytes maintain the mineral concentration of the matrix via the secretion of enzymes. Like osteoblasts,\\nosteocytes lack mitotic activity. They can communicate with each other and receive nutrients via long cytoplasmic\\nprocesses that extend through canaliculi (singular = canaliculus), channels within the bone matrix.\\nIf osteoblasts and osteocytes are incapable of mitosis, then how are they replenished when old ones die? The\\nanswer lies in the properties of a third category of bone cells—the osteogenic cell. These osteogenic cells are\\nundifferentiated with high mitotic activity and they are the only bone cells that divide. Immature osteogenic cells are\\nfound in the deep layers of the periosteum and the marrow. They differentiate and develop into osteoblasts.\\nThe dynamic nature of bone means that new tissue is constantly formed, and old, injured, or unnecessary bone is\\ndissolved for repair or for calcium release. The cell responsible for bone resorption, or breakdown, is the osteoclast.\\nThey are found on bone surfaces, are multinucleated, and originate from monocytes and macrophages, two types of\\nwhite blood cells, not from osteogenic cells. Osteoclasts are continually breaking down old bone while osteoblasts\\nare continually forming new bone. The ongoing balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is responsible for the\\nconstant but subtle reshaping of bone.

(Micrograph provided by the\\nRegents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\\nThe microscopic structural unit of compact bone is called an osteon, or Haversian system. Each osteon is composed\\nof concentric rings of calcified matrix called lamellae (singular = lamella). Running down the center of each osteon is\\nthe central canal, or Haversian canal, which contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels. These vessels\\nand nerves branch off at right angles through a perforating canal, also known as Volkmann’s canals, to extend to\\nthe periosteum and endosteum.\\nThe osteocytes are located inside spaces called lacunae (singular = lacuna), found at the borders of adjacent\\nlamellae. As described earlier, canaliculi connect with the canaliculi of other lacunae and eventually with the central\\ncanal. This system allows nutrients to be transported to the osteocytes and wastes to be removed from them.\\nSpongy (Cancellous) Bone\\nLike compact bone, spongy bone, also known as cancellous bone, contains osteocytes housed in lacunae, but they\\nare not arranged in concentric circles. Instead, the lacunae and osteocytes are found in a lattice-like network of\\nmatrix spikes called trabeculae (singular = trabecula) (Figure 6.13). The trabeculae may appear to be a random\\nnetwork, but each trabecula forms along lines of stress to provide strength to the bone. The spaces of the\\ntrabeculated network provide balance to the dense and heavy compact bone by making bones lighter so that\\nmuscles can move them more easily. In addition, the spaces in some spongy bones contain red marrow, protected\\nby the trabeculae, where hematopoiesis occurs.\\n6.3 • Bone Structure 203'),\n",

X-rays may show bone deformities or areas of\\nbone resorption. Bone scans are also useful. In these studies, a dye containing a radioactive ion is injected into\\nthe body.

By the sixth or seventh week of embryonic life, the actual process of bone development, ossification\\n(osteogenesis), begins. There are two osteogenic pathways—intramembranous ossification and endochondral\\nossification—but bone is the same regardless of the pathway that produces it.\\nCartilage Templates\\nBone is a replacement tissue; that is, it uses a model tissue on which to lay down its mineral matrix. For skeletal\\ndevelopment, the most common template is cartilage. During fetal development, a framework is laid down that\\ndetermines where bones will form. This framework is a flexible, semi-solid matrix produced by chondroblasts and\\nconsists of hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, collagen fibers, and water. As the matrix surrounds and isolates\\nchondroblasts, they are called chondrocytes. Unlike most connective tissues, cartilage is avascular, meaning that it\\nhas no blood vessels supplying nutrients and removing metabolic wastes. All of these functions are carried on by\\ndiffusion through the matrix. This is why damaged cartilage does not repair itself as readily as most tissues do.\\nThroughout fetal development and into childhood growth and development, bone forms on the cartilaginous matrix.\\nBy the time a fetus is born, most of the cartilage has been replaced with bone. Some additional cartilage will be\\nreplaced throughout childhood, and some cartilage remains in the adult skeleton.\\nIntramembranous Ossification\\nDuring intramembranous ossification, compact and spongy bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal\\n(undifferentiated) connective tissue. The flat bones of the face, most of the cranial bones, and the clavicles\\n(collarbones) are formed via intramembranous ossification.\\nThe process begins when mesenchymal cells in the embryonic skeleton gather together and begin to differentiate\\ninto specialized cells (Figure 6.16a). Some of these cells will differentiate into capillaries, while others will become\\nosteogenic cells and then osteoblasts. Although they will ultimately be spread out by the formation of bone tissue,\\nearly osteoblasts appear in a cluster called an ossification center.\\nThe osteoblasts secrete osteoid, uncalcified matrix, which calcifies (hardens) within a few days as mineral salts are\\ndeposited on it, thereby entrapping the osteoblasts within. Once entrapped, the osteoblasts become osteocytes\\n(Figure 6.16b). As osteoblasts transform into osteocytes, osteogenic cells in the surrounding connective tissue\\ndifferentiate into new osteoblasts.\\nOsteoid (unmineralized bone matrix) secreted around the capillaries results in a trabecular matrix, while osteoblasts\\non the surface of the spongy bone become the periosteum (Figure 6.16c). The periosteum then creates a protective\\nlayer of compact bone superficial to the trabecular bone. The trabecular bone crowds nearby blood vessels, which\\neventually condense into red marrow (Figure 6.16d).\\n206 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The last bones to ossify via intramembranous\\nossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt.\\nEndochondral Ossification\\nIn endochondral ossification, bone develops by replacing hyaline cartilage. Cartilage does not become bone.\\nInstead, cartilage serves as a template to be completely replaced by new bone. Endochondral ossification takes\\nmuch longer than intramembranous ossification. Bones at the base of the skull and long bones form via\\nendochondral ossification.\\nIn a long bone, for example, at about 6 to 8 weeks after conception, some of the mesenchymal cells differentiate\\ninto chondrocytes (cartilage cells) that form the cartilaginous skeletal precursor of the bones (Figure 6.17a).

This results in their death and the disintegration of the\\nsurrounding cartilage. Blood vessels invade the resulting spaces, not only enlarging the cavities but also carrying\\nosteogenic cells with them, many of which will become osteoblasts. These enlarging spaces eventually combine to\\nbecome the medullary cavity.\\nAs the cartilage grows, capillaries penetrate it. This penetration initiates the transformation of the perichondrium\\ninto the bone-producing periosteum. Here, the osteoblasts form a periosteal collar of compact bone around the\\ncartilage of the diaphysis. By the second or third month of fetal life, bone cell development and ossification ramps\\nup and creates the primary ossification center, a region deep in the periosteal collar where ossification begins\\n(Figure 6.17c).\\nWhile these deep changes are occurring, chondrocytes and cartilage continue to grow at the ends of the bone (the\\nfuture epiphyses), which increases the bone’s length at the same time bone is replacing cartilage in the diaphyses.\\nBy the time the fetal skeleton is fully formed, cartilage only remains at the joint surface as articular cartilage and\\nbetween the diaphysis and epiphysis as the epiphyseal plate, the latter of which is responsible for the longitudinal\\ngrowth of bones. After birth, this same sequence of events (matrix mineralization, death of chondrocytes, invasion of\\nblood vessels from the periosteum, and seeding with osteogenic cells that become osteoblasts) occurs in the\\nepiphyseal regions, and each of these centers of activity is referred to as a secondary ossification center (Figure\\n6.17e).\\nHow Bones Grow in Length\\nThe epiphyseal plate is the area of growth in a long bone. It is a layer of hyaline cartilage where ossification occurs in\\nimmature bones. On the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate, cartilage is formed. On the diaphyseal side,\\ncartilage is ossified, and the diaphysis grows in length. The epiphyseal plate is composed of four zones of cells and\\nactivity (Figure 6.18). The reserve zone is the region closest to the epiphyseal end of the plate and contains small\\nchondrocytes within the matrix. These chondrocytes do not participate in bone growth but secure the epiphyseal\\nplate to the osseous tissue of the epiphysis.\\n6.4 • Bone Formation and Development 209'),\n",

(a) Epiphyseal plates are visible in a growing bone.

This is called appositional growth. Osteoclasts resorb old bone that lines the\\nmedullary cavity, while osteoblasts, via intramembranous ossification, produce new bone tissue beneath the\\nperiosteum. The erosion of old bone along the medullary cavity and the deposition of new bone beneath the\\nperiosteum not only increase the diameter of the diaphysis but also increase the diameter of the medullary cavity.\\nThis process is called modeling.\\nBone Remodeling\\nThe process in which matrix is resorbed on one surface of a bone and deposited on another is known as bone\\nmodeling. Modeling primarily takes place during a bone’s growth. However, in adult life, bone undergoes\\nremodeling, in which resorption of old or damaged bone takes place on the same surface where osteoblasts lay\\nnew bone to replace that which is resorbed. Injury, exercise, and other activities lead to remodeling. Those\\ninfluences are discussed later in the chapter, but even without injury or exercise, about 5 to 10 percent of the\\nskeleton is remodeled annually just by destroying old bone and renewing it with fresh bone.\\nDiseases of the…\\nSkeletal System Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease in which bones do not form properly and\\ntherefore are fragile and break easily. It is also called brittle bone disease. The disease is present from birth and\\naffects a person throughout life.\\nThe genetic mutation that causes OI affects the body’s production of collagen, one of the critical components of\\nbone matrix. The severity of the disease can range from mild to severe. Those with the most severe forms of the\\ndisease sustain many more fractures than those with a mild form. Frequent and multiple fractures typically lead\\nto bone deformities and short stature. Bowing of the long bones and curvature of the spine are also common in\\npeople afflicted with OI. Curvature of the spine makes breathing difficult because the lungs are compressed.\\nBecause collagen is such an important structural protein in many parts of the body, people with OI may also\\nexperience fragile skin, weak muscles, loose joints, easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, brittle teeth, blue sclera,\\nand hearing loss. There is no known cure for OI. Treatment focuses on helping the person retain as much\\nindependence as possible while minimizing fractures and maximizing mobility.

If the bone is\\nnot reset correctly, the healing process will keep the bone in its deformed position.\\nWhen a broken bone is manipulated and set into its natural position without surgery, the procedure is called a\\nclosed reduction. Open reduction requires surgery to expose the fracture and reset the bone. While some fractures\\ncan be minor, others are quite severe and result in grave complications. For example, a fractured diaphysis of the\\nfemur has the potential to release fat globules into the bloodstream. These can become lodged in the capillary beds\\nof the lungs, leading to respiratory distress and if not treated quickly, death.\\nTypes of Fractures\\nFractures are classified by their complexity, location, and other features (Figure 6.20). Table 6.4 outlines common\\ntypes of fractures. Some fractures may be described using more than one term because it may have the features of\\nmore than one type (e.g., an open transverse fracture).\\nlike swimming, in which the body is less likely to experience collisions or compressive forces, are recommended.\\nBraces to support legs, ankles, knees, and wrists are used as needed.

In some cases, metal rods may be surgically implanted\\ninto the long bones of the arms and legs. Research is currently being conducted on using bisphosphonates to\\ntreat OI. Smoking and being overweight are especially risky in people with OI, since smoking is known to\\nweaken bones, and extra body weight puts additional stress on the bones.\\n212 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The food you take\\nin via your digestive system and the hormones secreted by your endocrine system affect your bones. Even using\\nyour muscles to engage in exercise has an impact on your bones.\\nExercise and Bone Tissue\\nDuring long space missions, astronauts can lose approximately 1 to 2 percent of their bone mass per month. This\\nloss of bone mass is thought to be caused by the lack of mechanical stress on astronauts’ bones due to the low\\ngravitational forces in space. Lack of mechanical stress causes bones to lose mineral salts and collagen fibers, and\\nthus strength. Similarly, mechanical stress stimulates the deposition of mineral salts and collagen fibers. The\\ninternal and external structure of a bone will change as stress increases or decreases so that the bone is an ideal\\nsize and weight for the amount of activity it endures. That is why people who exercise regularly have thicker bones\\nthan people who are more sedentary. It is also why a broken bone in a cast atrophies while its contralateral mate\\nmaintains its concentration of mineral salts and collagen fibers. The bones undergo remodeling as a result of forces\\n(or lack of forces) placed on them.\\nNumerous, controlled studies have demonstrated that people who exercise regularly have greater bone density than\\nthose who are more sedentary. Any type of exercise will stimulate the deposition of more bone tissue, but resistance\\ntraining has a greater effect than cardiovascular activities. Resistance training is especially important to slow down\\nthe eventual bone loss due to aging and for preventing osteoporosis.\\nNutrition and Bone Tissue\\nThe vitamins and minerals contained in all of the food we consume are important for all of our organ systems.\\nHowever, there are certain nutrients that affect bone health.\\nCalcium and Vitamin D\\nYou already know that calcium is a critical component of bone, especially in the form of calcium phosphate and\\ncalcium carbonate. Since the body cannot make calcium, it must be obtained from the diet. However, calcium\\ncannot be absorbed from the small intestine without vitamin D. Therefore, intake of vitamin D is also critical to bone\\nhealth. In addition to vitamin D’s role in calcium absorption, it also plays a role, though not as clearly understood, in\\nbone remodeling.\\nMilk and other dairy foods are not the only sources of calcium. This important nutrient is also found in green leafy\\nvegetables, broccoli, and intact salmon and canned sardines with their soft bones. Nuts, beans, seeds, and shellfish\\nprovide calcium in smaller quantities.\\nExcept for fatty fish like salmon and tuna, or fortified milk or cereal, vitamin D is not found naturally in many foods.\\nThe action of sunlight on the skin triggers the body to produce its own vitamin D (Figure 6.22), but many people,\\nespecially those of darker complexion and those living in northern latitudes where the sun’s rays are not as strong,\\nare deficient in vitamin D. In cases of deficiency, a doctor can prescribe a vitamin D supplement.\\n6.6 • Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones, and Bone Tissue 215'),\n",

These\\nhormones are involved in controlling bone growth, maintaining bone once it is formed, and remodeling it.\\nHormones That Influence Osteoblasts and/or Maintain the Matrix\\nSeveral hormones are necessary for controlling bone growth and maintaining the bone matrix. The pituitary gland\\nsecretes growth hormone (GH), which, as its name implies, controls bone growth in several ways. It triggers\\nchondrocyte proliferation in epiphyseal plates, resulting in the increasing length of long bones. GH also increases\\ncalcium retention, which enhances mineralization, and stimulates osteoblastic activity, which improves bone\\ndensity.\\nGH is not alone in stimulating bone growth and maintaining osseous tissue. Thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the\\nthyroid gland promotes osteoblastic activity and the synthesis of bone matrix. During puberty, the sex hormones\\n(estrogen and testosterone) also come into play. They too promote osteoblastic activity and production of bone\\nmatrix, and in addition, are responsible for the growth spurt that often occurs during adolescence. They also\\npromote the conversion of the epiphyseal plate to the epiphyseal line (i.e., cartilage to its bony remnant), thus\\nbringing an end to the longitudinal growth of bones. Additionally, calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is produced\\nby the kidneys and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the digestive tract.\\nAging and the...\\nSkeletal System\\nOsteoporosis is a disease characterized by a decrease in bone mass that occurs when the rate of bone\\nresorption exceeds the rate of bone formation, a common occurrence as the body ages. Notice how this is\\ndifferent from Paget’s disease. In Paget’s disease, new bone is formed in an attempt to keep up with the\\nresorption by the overactive osteoclasts, but that new bone is produced haphazardly.

Two hormones that affect the osteoclasts are parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin.\\nPTH stimulates osteoclast proliferation and activity. As a result, calcium is released from the bones into the\\ncirculation, thus increasing the calcium ion concentration in the blood. PTH also promotes the reabsorption of\\ncalcium by the kidney tubules, which can affect calcium homeostasis (see below).\\nThe small intestine is also affected by PTH, albeit indirectly. Because another function of PTH is to stimulate the\\nFIGURE 6.23 Graph Showing Relationship Between Age and Bone Mass Bone density peaks at about 30 years of age. Females\\nlose bone mass more rapidly than males.\\nWhile osteoporosis can involve any bone, it most commonly affects the proximal ends of the femur, vertebrae,\\nand wrist. As a result of the loss of bone density, the osseous tissue may not provide adequate support for\\neveryday functions, and something as simple as a sneeze can cause a vertebral fracture. When an elderly person\\nfalls and breaks a hip (really, the femur), it is very likely the femur that broke first, which resulted in the fall.\\nHistologically, osteoporosis is characterized by a reduction in the thickness of compact bone and the number\\nand size of trabeculae in cancellous bone.\\nFigure 6.23 shows that females lose bone mass more quickly than males starting at about 50 years of age. This\\noccurs because 50 is the approximate age at which females go through menopause. Not only do their menstrual\\nperiods lessen and eventually cease, but their ovaries reduce in size and then cease the production of estrogen,\\na hormone that promotes osteoblastic activity and production of bone matrix. Thus, osteoporosis is more\\ncommon in females, but males can develop it, too. Anyone with a family history of osteoporosis has a greater\\nrisk of developing the disease, so the best treatment is prevention, which should start with a childhood diet that\\nincludes adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D and a lifestyle that includes weight-bearing exercise. These\\nactions, as discussed above, are important in building bone mass. Promoting proper nutrition and weight-\\nbearing exercise early in life can maximize bone mass before the age of 30, thus reducing the risk of\\nosteoporosis.\\nFor many elderly people, a hip fracture can be life threatening. The fracture itself may not be serious, but the\\nimmobility that comes during the healing process can lead to the formation of blood clots that can lodge in the\\ncapillaries of the lungs, resulting in respiratory failure; pneumonia due to the lack of poor air exchange that\\naccompanies immobility; pressure sores (bed sores) that allow pathogens to enter the body and cause\\ninfections; and urinary tract infections from catheterization.\\nCurrent treatments for managing osteoporosis include bisphosphonates (the same medications often used in\\nPaget’s disease), calcitonin, and estrogen (for females only). Minimizing the risk of falls, for example, by\\nremoving tripping hazards, is also an important step in managing the potential outcomes from the disease.\\n218 6 • Bone Tissue and the Skeletal System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The normal level of calcium in the blood is about 10 mg/dL. When the body cannot maintain\\nthis level, a person will experience hypo- or hypercalcemia.\\nHypocalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium, can have an adverse effect on a\\nnumber of different body systems including circulation, muscles, nerves, and bone. Without adequate calcium,\\nblood has difficulty coagulating, the heart may skip beats or stop beating altogether, muscles may have difficulty\\ncontracting, nerves may have difficulty functioning, and bones may become brittle. The causes of hypocalcemia can\\nrange from hormonal imbalances to an improper diet. Treatments vary according to the cause, but prognoses are\\ngenerally good.\\nConversely, in hypercalcemia, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of calcium, the nervous system is\\nunderactive, which results in lethargy, sluggish reflexes, constipation and loss of appetite, confusion, and in severe\\ncases, coma.\\nObviously, calcium homeostasis is critical. The skeletal, endocrine, and digestive systems play a role in this, but the\\nkidneys do, too. These body systems work together to maintain a normal calcium level in the blood (Figure 6.24).\\n6.7 • Calcium Homeostasis: Interactions of the Skeletal System and Other Organ Systems 219'),\n",

The only way it can enter the\\nbody is through the diet. The bones act as a storage site for calcium: The body deposits calcium in the bones when\\nblood levels get too high, and it releases calcium when blood levels drop too low. This process is regulated by PTH,\\nvitamin D, and calcitonin.\\nCells of the parathyroid gland have plasma membrane receptors for calcium. When calcium is not binding to these\\nreceptors, the cells release PTH, which stimulates osteoclast proliferation and resorption of bone by osteoclasts.\\nThis demineralization process releases calcium into the blood. PTH promotes reabsorption of calcium from the urine\\nby the kidneys, so that the calcium returns to the blood. Finally, PTH stimulates the synthesis of vitamin D, which in\\nturn, stimulates calcium absorption from any digested food in the small intestine.\\nWhen all these processes return blood calcium levels to normal, there is enough calcium to bind with the receptors\\non the surface of the cells of the parathyroid glands, and this cycle of events is turned off (Figure 6.24).\\nWhen blood levels of calcium get too high, the thyroid gland is stimulated to release calcitonin (Figure 6.24), which\\ninhibits osteoclast activity and stimulates calcium uptake by the bones, but also decreases reabsorption of calcium\\nby the kidneys. All of these actions lower blood levels of calcium.

Long\\nbones, such as the femur, are longer than they are\\nwide. Short bones, such as the carpals, are\\napproximately equal in length, width, and thickness.\\nFlat bones are thin, but are often curved, such as the\\nribs. Irregular bones such as those of the face have no\\ncharacteristic shape. Sesamoid bones, such as the\\npatellae, are small and round, and are located in\\ntendons.\\n6.3 Bone Structure\\nA hollow medullary cavity filled with yellow marrow\\nruns the length of the diaphysis of a long bone. The\\nwalls of the diaphysis are compact bone. The\\nepiphyses, which are wider sections at each end of a\\nlong bone, are filled with spongy bone and red marrow.\\nThe epiphyseal plate, a layer of hyaline cartilage, is\\nreplaced by osseous tissue as the organ grows in\\nlength. The medullary cavity has a delicate\\nmembranous lining called the endosteum. The outer\\nsurface of bone, except in regions covered with\\narticular cartilage, is covered with a fibrous membrane\\ncalled the periosteum. Flat bones consist of two layers\\nof compact bone surrounding a layer of spongy bone.\\nBone markings depend on the function and location of\\nbones. Articulations are places where two bones meet.\\nProjections stick out from the surface of the bone and\\nprovide attachment points for tendons and ligaments.\\nHoles are openings or depressions in the bones.\\nBone matrix consists of collagen fibers and organic\\nground substance, primarily hydroxyapatite formed\\nfrom calcium salts. Osteogenic cells develop into\\nosteoblasts. Osteoblasts are cells that make new bone.\\nThey become osteocytes, the cells of mature bone,\\nwhen they get trapped in the matrix. Osteoclasts\\nengage in bone resorption. Compact bone is dense and\\ncomposed of osteons, while spongy bone is less dense\\nand made up of trabeculae. Blood vessels and nerves\\nenter the bone through the nutrient foramina to\\nnourish and innervate bones.\\n6.4 Bone Formation and Development\\nAll bone formation is a replacement process.

Fractures are classified by their\\ncomplexity, location, and other features. Common\\ntypes of fractures are transverse, oblique, spiral,\\ncomminuted, impacted, greenstick, open (or\\ncompound), and closed (or simple). Healing of\\nfractures begins with the formation of a hematoma,\\nfollowed by internal and external calli.

Calcium, the\\npredominant mineral in bone, cannot be absorbed from\\nthe small intestine if vitamin D is lacking. Vitamin K\\nsupports bone mineralization and may have a\\nsynergistic role with vitamin D. Magnesium and\\nfluoride, as structural elements, play a supporting role\\nin bone health. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce\\ninflammation and may promote production of new\\nosseous tissue. Growth hormone increases the length\\nof long bones, enhances mineralization, and improves\\nbone density. Thyroxine stimulates bone growth and\\npromotes the synthesis of bone matrix. The sex\\nhormones (estrogen and testosterone) promote\\nosteoblastic activity and the production of bone matrix,\\nare responsible for the adolescent growth spurt, and\\npromote closure of the epiphyseal plates.

It consists of the bones,\\ncartilages, and ligaments. Bones support the weight of the body, allow for body movements, and protect internal\\norgans. Cartilage provides flexible strength and support for body structures such as the thoracic cage, the external\\near, and the trachea and larynx. At joints of the body, cartilage can also unite adjacent bones or provide cushioning\\nbetween them. Ligaments are the strong connective tissue bands that hold the bones at a moveable joint together\\nand serve to prevent excessive movements of the joint that would result in injury. Providing movement of the\\nskeleton are the muscles of the body, which are firmly attached to the skeleton via connective tissue structures\\ncalled tendons. As muscles contract, they pull on the bones to produce movements of the body. Thus, without a\\nskeleton, you would not be able to stand, run, or even feed yourself!\\nEach bone of the body serves a particular function, and therefore bones vary in size, shape, and strength based on\\nthese functions. For example, the bones of the lower back and lower limb are thick and strong to support your body\\nweight. Similarly, the size of a bony landmark that serves as a muscle attachment site on an individual bone is\\nrelated to the strength of this muscle. Muscles can apply very strong pulling forces to the bones of the skeleton. To\\nresist these forces, bones have enlarged bony landmarks at sites where powerful muscles attach. This means that\\nnot only the size of a bone, but also its shape, is related to its function. For this reason, the identification of bony\\nlandmarks is important during your study of the skeletal system.\\nBones are also dynamic organs that can modify their strength and thickness in response to changes in muscle\\nstrength or body weight. Thus, muscle attachment sites on bones will thicken if you begin a workout program that\\nincreases muscle strength. Similarly, the walls of weight-bearing bones will thicken if you gain body weight or begin\\npounding the pavement as part of a new running regimen. In contrast, a reduction in muscle strength or body weight\\nFigure 7.1 Lateral View of the Human Skull'),\n",

This may happen during a prolonged hospital stay, following limb\\nimmobilization in a cast, or going into the weightlessness of outer space. Even a change in diet, such as eating only\\nsoft food due to the loss of teeth, will result in a noticeable decrease in the size and thickness of the jaw bones.\\n7.1 Divisions of the Skeletal System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the functions of the skeletal system\\n• Distinguish between the axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton\\n• Define the axial skeleton and its components\\n• Define the appendicular skeleton and its components\\nThe skeletal system includes all of the bones, cartilages, and ligaments of the body that support and give shape to\\nthe body and body structures. The skeleton consists of the bones of the body. For adults, there are 206 bones in the\\nskeleton. Younger individuals have higher numbers of bones because some bones fuse together during childhood\\nand adolescence to form an adult bone. The primary functions of the skeleton are to provide a rigid, internal\\nstructure that can support the weight of the body against the force of gravity, and to provide a structure upon which\\nmuscles can act to produce movements of the body. The lower portion of the skeleton is specialized for stability\\nduring walking or running. In contrast, the upper skeleton has greater mobility and ranges of motion, features that\\nallow you to lift and carry objects or turn your head and trunk.\\nIn addition to providing for support and movements of the body, the skeleton has protective and storage functions.\\nIt protects the internal organs, including the brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, and pelvic organs. The bones of the\\nskeleton serve as the primary storage site for important minerals such as calcium and phosphate. The bone marrow\\nfound within bones stores fat and houses the blood-cell producing tissue of the body.\\nThe skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular.\\nThe Axial Skeleton\\nThe skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions—the axial and appendicular. The axial skeleton forms the\\nvertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back (Figure 7.2). It serves to\\nprotect the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the\\nhead, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs.\\nThe axial skeleton of the adult consists of 80 bones, including the skull, the vertebral column, and the thoracic\\ncage. The skull is formed by 22 bones. Also associated with the head are an additional seven bones, including the\\nhyoid bone and the ear ossicles (three small bones found in each middle ear). The vertebral column consists of 24\\nbones, each called a vertebra, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The thoracic cage includes the 12 pairs of ribs, and the\\nsternum, the flattened bone of the anterior chest.\\n228 7 • Axial Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The upper portion of\\nthe nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the lower portion is the vomer\\nbone. Each side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad inferior space that narrows superiorly. When\\nlooking into the nasal cavity from the front of the skull, two bony plates are seen projecting from each lateral wall.\\nThe larger of these is the inferior nasal concha, an independent bone of the skull.

Separating these areas is the bridge of bone called the zygomatic arch. The\\nzygomatic arch is the bony arch on the side of skull that spans from the area of the cheek to just above the ear\\ncanal. It is formed by the junction of two bony processes: a short anterior component, the temporal process of the\\nzygomatic bone (the cheekbone) and a longer posterior portion, the zygomatic process of the temporal bone,\\nextending forward from the temporal bone. Thus the temporal process (anteriorly) and the zygomatic process\\n(posteriorly) join together, like the two ends of a drawbridge, to form the zygomatic arch. One of the major muscles\\nthat pulls the mandible upward during biting and chewing arises from the zygomatic arch.\\nOn the lateral side of the brain case, above the level of the zygomatic arch, is a shallow space called the temporal\\nfossa. Below the level of the zygomatic arch and deep to the vertical portion of the mandible is another space called\\nthe infratemporal fossa. Both the temporal fossa and infratemporal fossa contain muscles that act on the mandible\\nduring chewing.\\n7.2 • The Skull 231'),\n",

These include the paired parietal and temporal bones, plus the unpaired\\nfrontal, occipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones.\\nParietal Bone\\nThe parietal bone forms most of the upper lateral side of the skull (see Figure 7.5). These are paired bones, with the\\nright and left parietal bones joining together at the top of the skull. Each parietal bone is also bounded anteriorly by\\nthe frontal bone, inferiorly by the temporal bone, and posteriorly by the occipital bone.\\nTemporal Bone\\nThe temporal bone forms the lower lateral side of the skull (see Figure 7.5). Common wisdom has it that the\\ntemporal bone (temporal = “time”) is so named because this area of the head (the temple) is where hair typically\\nfirst turns gray, indicating the passage of time.\\nThe temporal bone is subdivided into several regions (Figure 7.7). The flattened, upper portion is the squamous\\nportion of the temporal bone. Below this area and projecting anteriorly is the zygomatic process of the temporal\\nbone, which forms the posterior portion of the zygomatic arch. Posteriorly is the mastoid portion of the temporal\\nbone. Projecting inferiorly from this region is a large prominence, the mastoid process, which serves as a muscle\\nattachment site. The mastoid process can easily be felt on the side of the head just behind your earlobe. On the\\ninterior of the skull, the petrous portion of each temporal bone forms the prominent, diagonally oriented petrous\\nridge in the floor of the cranial cavity. Located inside each petrous ridge are small cavities that house the structures\\nof the middle and inner ears.\\n7.2 • The Skull 233'),\n",

It connects to the middle and inner ear cavities of the temporal bone.\\n• Mandibular fossa—This is the deep, oval-shaped depression located on the external base of the skull, just in\\nfront of the external acoustic meatus. The mandible (lower jaw) joins with the skull at this site as part of the\\ntemporomandibular joint, which allows for movements of the mandible during opening and closing of the\\nmouth.\\n• Articular tubercle—The smooth ridge located immediately anterior to the mandibular fossa.

On its outside surface, at the posterior midline, is a small protrusion called the external\\noccipital protuberance, which serves as an attachment site for a ligament of the posterior neck. Lateral to either\\nside of this bump is a superior nuchal line (nuchal = “nape” or “posterior neck”). The nuchal lines represent the\\nmost superior point at which muscles of the neck attach to the skull, with only the scalp covering the skull above\\nthese lines. On the base of the skull, the occipital bone contains the large opening of the foramen magnum, which\\nallows for passage of the spinal cord as it exits the skull. On either side of the foramen magnum is an oval-shaped\\noccipital condyle. These condyles form joints with the first cervical vertebra and thus support the skull on top of the\\nvertebral column.\\nFIGURE 7.9 Posterior View of Skull This view of the posterior skull shows attachment sites for muscles and joints that support the\\nskull.\\nSphenoid Bone\\nThe sphenoid bone is a single, complex bone of the central skull (Figure 7.10). It serves as a “keystone” bone,\\nbecause it joins with almost every other bone of the skull. The sphenoid forms much of the base of the central skull\\n(see Figure 7.8) and also extends laterally to contribute to the sides of the skull (see Figure 7.5). Inside the cranial\\ncavity, the right and left lesser wings of the sphenoid bone, which resemble the wings of a flying bird, form the lip\\nof a prominent ridge that marks the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae. The sella turcica\\n(“Turkish saddle”) is located at the midline of the middle cranial fossa. This bony region of the sphenoid bone is\\nnamed for its resemblance to the horse saddles used by the Ottoman Turks, with a high back and a tall front. The\\nrounded depression in the floor of the sella turcica is the hypophyseal (pituitary) fossa, which houses the pea-\\nsized pituitary (hypophyseal) gland. The greater wings of the sphenoid bone extend laterally to either side away\\nfrom the sella turcica, where they form the anterior floor of the middle cranial fossa. The greater wing is best seen\\non the outside of the lateral skull, where it forms a rectangular area immediately anterior to the squamous portion of\\nthe temporal bone.\\nOn the inferior aspect of the skull, each half of the sphenoid bone forms two thin, vertically oriented bony plates.\\nThese are the medial pterygoid plate and lateral pterygoid plate (pterygoid = “wing-shaped”). The right and left\\nmedial pterygoid plates form the posterior, lateral walls of the nasal cavity. The somewhat larger lateral pterygoid\\nplates serve as attachment sites for chewing muscles that fill the infratemporal space and act on the mandible.\\n236 7 • Axial Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The sphenoid has multiple openings for\\nthe passage of nerves and blood vessels, including the optic canal, superior orbital fissure, foramen rotundum, foramen ovale, and foramen\\nspinosum.\\nEthmoid Bone\\nThe ethmoid bone is a single, midline bone that forms the roof and lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity, the upper\\nportion of the nasal septum, and contributes to the medial wall of the orbit (Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12). On the\\ninterior of the skull, the ethmoid also forms a portion of the floor of the anterior cranial cavity (see Figure 7.8b).\\nWithin the nasal cavity, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone forms the upper portion of the nasal septum.\\nThe ethmoid bone also forms the lateral walls of the upper nasal cavity.

This portion of the ethmoid bone consists of\\ntwo parts, the crista galli and cribriform plates. The crista galli (“rooster’s comb or crest”) is a small upward bony\\nprojection located at the midline. It functions as an anterior attachment point for one of the covering layers of the\\nbrain. To either side of the crista galli is the cribriform plate (cribrum = “sieve”), a small, flattened area with\\nnumerous small openings termed olfactory foramina. Small nerve branches from the olfactory areas of the nasal\\ncavity pass through these openings to enter the brain.\\nThe lateral portions of the ethmoid bone are located between the orbit and upper nasal cavity, and thus form the\\nlateral nasal cavity wall and a portion of the medial orbit wall.

These twisting lines serve to tightly interlock\\nthe adjacent bones, thus adding strength to the skull for brain protection.\\nThe two suture lines seen on the top of the skull are the coronal and sagittal sutures. The coronal suture runs from\\nside to side across the skull, within the coronal plane of section (see Figure 7.5). It joins the frontal bone to the right\\nand left parietal bones. The sagittal suture extends posteriorly from the coronal suture, running along the midline at\\nthe top of the skull in the sagittal plane of section (see Figure 7.9). It unites the right and left parietal bones. On the\\nposterior skull, the sagittal suture terminates by joining the lambdoid suture. The lambdoid suture extends\\ndownward and laterally to either side away from its junction with the sagittal suture. The lambdoid suture joins the\\noccipital bone to the right and left parietal and temporal bones. This suture is named for its upside-down \"V\" shape,\\nwhich resembles the capital letter version of the Greek letter lambda (Λ). The squamous suture is located on the\\nlateral skull. It unites the squamous portion of the temporal bone with the parietal bone (see Figure 7.5). At the\\nintersection of four bones is the pterion, a small, capital-H-shaped suture line region that unites the frontal bone,\\nparietal bone, squamous portion of the temporal bone, and greater wing of the sphenoid bone.

Why may a basilar\\nfracture be life threatening?\\nFacial Bones of the Skull\\nThe facial bones of the skull form the upper and lower jaws, the nose, nasal cavity and nasal septum, and the orbit.\\nThe facial bones include 14 bones, with six paired bones and two unpaired bones. The paired bones are the maxilla,\\npalatine, zygomatic, nasal, lacrimal, and inferior nasal conchae bones. The unpaired bones are the vomer and\\nmandible bones. Although classified with the brain-case bones, the ethmoid bone also contributes to the nasal\\nseptum and the walls of the nasal cavity and orbit.\\nMaxillary Bone\\nThe maxillary bone, often referred to simply as the maxilla (plural = maxillae), is one of a pair that together form the\\nupper jaw, much of the hard palate, the medial floor of the orbit, and the lateral base of the nose (see Figure 7.4).\\nThe curved, inferior margin of the maxillary bone that forms the upper jaw and contains the upper teeth is the\\nalveolar process of the maxilla (Figure 7.14). Each tooth is anchored into a deep socket called an alveolus. On the\\nanterior maxilla, just below the orbit, is the infraorbital foramen. This is the point of exit for a sensory nerve that\\nsupplies the nose, upper lip, and anterior cheek. On the inferior skull, the palatine process from each maxillary\\nbone can be seen joining together at the midline to form the anterior three-quarters of the hard palate (see Figure\\n7.8a). The hard palate is the bony plate that forms the roof of the mouth and floor of the nasal cavity, separating the\\noral and nasal cavities.\\nStrong blows to the brain-case portion of the skull can produce fractures. These may result in bleeding inside\\nthe skull with subsequent injury to the brain. The most common is a linear skull fracture, in which fracture lines\\nradiate from the point of impact. Other fracture types include a comminuted fracture, in which the bone is\\nbroken into several pieces at the point of impact, or a depressed fracture, in which the fractured bone is pushed\\ninward. In a contrecoup (counterblow) fracture, the bone at the point of impact is not broken, but instead a\\nfracture occurs on the opposite side of the skull. Fractures of the occipital bone at the base of the skull can\\noccur in this manner, producing a basilar fracture that can damage the artery that passes through the carotid\\ncanal.\\nA blow to the lateral side of the head may fracture the bones of the pterion. The pterion is an important clinical\\nlandmark because located immediately deep to it on the inside of the skull is a major branch of an artery that\\nsupplies the skull and covering layers of the brain. A strong blow to this region can fracture the bones around the\\npterion. If the underlying artery is damaged, bleeding can cause the formation of a hematoma (collection of\\nblood) between the brain and interior of the skull. As blood accumulates, it will put pressure on the brain.\\nSymptoms associated with a hematoma may not be apparent immediately following the injury, but if untreated,\\nblood accumulation will exert increasing pressure on the brain and can result in death within a few hours.\\n240 7 • Axial Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The hard palate is the bony\\nstructure that separates the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. It is formed during embryonic development by the\\nmidline fusion of the horizontal plates from the right and left palatine bones and the palatine processes of the\\nmaxilla bones. Cleft palate affects approximately 1:2500 births and is more common in females. It results from a\\nfailure of the two halves of the hard palate to completely come together and fuse at the midline, thus leaving a gap\\nbetween them. This gap allows for communication between the nasal and oral cavities. In severe cases, the bony\\ngap continues into the anterior upper jaw where the alveolar processes of the maxilla bones also do not properly\\njoin together above the front teeth. If this occurs, a cleft lip will also be seen. Because of the communication\\nbetween the oral and nasal cavities, a cleft palate makes it very difficult for an infant to generate the suckling\\nneeded for nursing, thus leaving the infant at risk for malnutrition. Surgical repair is required to correct cleft palate\\ndefects.\\n7.2 • The Skull 241'),\n",

Each of the paired zygomatic bones forms much of the lateral\\nwall of the orbit and the lateral-inferior margins of the anterior orbital opening (see Figure 7.4). The short temporal\\nprocess of the zygomatic bone projects posteriorly, where it forms the anterior portion of the zygomatic arch (see\\nFigure 7.5).\\nNasal Bone\\nThe nasal bone is one of two small bones that articulate (join) with each other to form the bony base (bridge) of the\\nnose. They also support the cartilages that form the lateral walls of the nose (see Figure 7.11). These are the bones\\nthat are damaged when the nose is broken.\\nLacrimal Bone\\nEach lacrimal bone is a small, rectangular bone that forms the anterior, medial wall of the orbit (see Figure 7.4 and\\nFigure 7.5). The anterior portion of the lacrimal bone forms a shallow depression called the lacrimal fossa, and\\nextending inferiorly from this is the nasolacrimal canal. The lacrimal fluid (tears of the eye), which serves to\\nmaintain the moist surface of the eye, drains at the medial corner of the eye into the nasolacrimal canal. This duct\\nthen extends downward to open into the nasal cavity, behind the inferior nasal concha. In the nasal cavity, the\\nlacrimal fluid normally drains posteriorly, but with an increased flow of tears due to crying or eye irritation, some\\nfluid will also drain anteriorly, thus causing a runny nose.\\nInferior Nasal Conchae\\nThe right and left inferior nasal conchae form a curved bony plate that projects into the nasal cavity space from the\\nlower lateral wall (see Figure 7.13). The inferior concha is the largest of the nasal conchae and can easily be seen\\nwhen looking into the anterior opening of the nasal cavity.\\nVomer Bone\\nThe unpaired vomer bone, often referred to simply as the vomer, is triangular-shaped and forms the posterior-\\ninferior part of the nasal septum (see Figure 7.11). The vomer is best seen when looking from behind into the\\nposterior openings of the nasal cavity (see Figure 7.8a). In this view, the vomer is seen to form the entire height of\\nthe nasal septum. A much smaller portion of the vomer can also be seen when looking into the anterior opening of\\nthe nasal cavity.\\nMandible\\nThe mandible forms the lower jaw and is the only moveable bone of the skull. At the time of birth, the mandible\\nconsists of paired right and left bones, but these fuse together during the first year to form the single U-shaped\\nmandible of the adult skull. Each side of the mandible consists of a horizontal body and posteriorly, a vertically\\noriented ramus of the mandible (ramus = “branch”). The outside margin of the mandible, where the body and\\nramus come together is called the angle of the mandible (Figure 7.15).\\nThe ramus on each side of the mandible has two upward-going bony projections. The more anterior projection is the\\nflattened coronoid process of the mandible, which provides attachment for one of the biting muscles. The posterior\\nprojection is the condylar process of the mandible, which is topped by the oval-shaped condyle. The condyle of\\nthe mandible articulates (joins) with the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the temporal bone. Together\\nthese articulations form the temporomandibular joint, which allows for opening and closing of the mouth (see Figure\\n7.5). The broad U-shaped curve located between the coronoid and condylar processes is the mandibular notch.\\nImportant landmarks for the mandible include the following:\\n• Alveolar process of the mandible—This is the upper border of the mandibular body and serves to anchor the\\nlower teeth.\\n• Mental protuberance—The forward projection from the inferior margin of the anterior mandible that forms the\\nchin (mental = “chin”).\\n• Mental foramen—The opening located on each side of the anterior-lateral mandible, which is the exit site for a\\nsensory nerve that supplies the chin.\\n• Mylohyoid line—This bony ridge extends along the inner aspect of the mandibular body (see Figure 7.11). The\\nmuscle that forms the floor of the oral cavity attaches to the mylohyoid lines on both sides of the mandible.\\n• Mandibular foramen—This opening is located on the medial side of the ramus of the mandible.

It is located immediately next\\nto the mandibular foramen, on the medial side of the ramus. A ligament that anchors the mandible during\\nopening and closing of the mouth extends down from the base of the skull and attaches to the lingula.\\nFIGURE 7.15 Isolated Mandible The mandible is the only moveable bone of the skull.\\nThe Orbit\\nThe orbit is the bony socket that houses the eyeball and contains the muscles that move the eyeball or open the\\nupper eyelid. Each orbit is cone-shaped, with a narrow posterior region that widens toward the large anterior\\nopening. To help protect the eye, the bony margins of the anterior opening are thickened and somewhat constricted.\\nThe medial walls of the two orbits are parallel to each other but each lateral wall diverges away from the midline at a\\n45° angle. This divergence provides greater lateral peripheral vision.\\nThe walls of each orbit include contributions from seven skull bones (Figure 7.16). The frontal bone forms the roof\\nand the zygomatic bone forms the lateral wall and lateral floor. The medial floor is primarily formed by the maxilla,\\nwith a small contribution from the palatine bone. The ethmoid bone and lacrimal bone make up much of the medial\\nwall and the sphenoid bone forms the posterior orbit.\\nAt the posterior apex of the orbit is the opening of the optic canal, which allows for passage of the optic nerve from\\nthe retina to the brain. Lateral to this is the elongated and irregularly shaped superior orbital fissure, which provides\\npassage for the artery that supplies the eyeball, sensory nerves, and the nerves that supply the muscles involved in\\neye movements.\\n7.2 • The Skull 243'),\n",

The upper\\nportion of the septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The lower and posterior parts of the\\nseptum are formed by the triangular-shaped vomer bone. In an anterior view of the skull, the perpendicular plate of\\nthe ethmoid bone is easily seen inside the nasal opening as the upper nasal septum, but only a small portion of the\\nvomer is seen as the inferior septum. A better view of the vomer bone is seen when looking into the posterior nasal\\ncavity with an inferior view of the skull, where the vomer forms the full height of the nasal septum. The anterior\\nnasal septum is formed by the septal cartilage, a flexible plate that fills in the gap between the perpendicular plate\\nof the ethmoid and vomer bones. This cartilage also extends outward into the nose where it separates the right and\\nleft nostrils. The septal cartilage is not found in the dry skull.\\nAttached to the lateral wall on each side of the nasal cavity are the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae\\n(singular = concha), which are named for their positions (see Figure 7.13). These are bony plates that curve\\ndownward as they project into the space of the nasal cavity. They serve to swirl the incoming air, which helps to\\nwarm and moisturize it before the air moves into the delicate air sacs of the lungs. This also allows mucus, secreted\\nby the tissue lining the nasal cavity, to trap incoming dust, pollen, bacteria, and viruses. The largest of the conchae is\\nthe inferior nasal concha, which is an independent bone of the skull. The middle concha and the superior conchae,\\nwhich is the smallest, are both formed by the ethmoid bone. When looking into the anterior nasal opening of the\\nskull, only the inferior and middle conchae can be seen. The small superior nasal concha is well hidden above and\\nbehind the middle concha.\\n244 7 • Axial Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Since the brain occupies these areas,\\nthe shape of each conforms to the shape of the brain regions that it contains. Each cranial fossa has anterior and\\nposterior boundaries and is divided at the midline into right and left areas by a significant bony structure or opening.\\nAnterior Cranial Fossa\\nThe anterior cranial fossa is the most anterior and the shallowest of the three cranial fossae. It overlies the orbits\\nand contains the frontal lobes of the brain. Anteriorly, the anterior fossa is bounded by the frontal bone, which also\\nforms the majority of the floor for this space. The lesser wings of the sphenoid bone form the prominent ledge that\\nmarks the boundary between the anterior and middle cranial fossae. Located in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa\\nat the midline is a portion of the ethmoid bone, consisting of the upward projecting crista galli and to either side of\\nthis, the cribriform plates.\\nMiddle Cranial Fossa\\nThe middle cranial fossa is deeper and situated posterior to the anterior fossa. It extends from the lesser wings of\\nthe sphenoid bone anteriorly, to the petrous ridges (petrous portion of the temporal bones) posteriorly. The large,\\ndiagonally positioned petrous ridges give the middle cranial fossa a butterfly shape, making it narrow at the midline\\nand broad laterally. The temporal lobes of the brain occupy this fossa. The middle cranial fossa is divided at the\\nmidline by the upward bony prominence of the sella turcica, a part of the sphenoid bone. The middle cranial fossa\\nhas several openings for the passage of blood vessels and cranial nerves (see Figure 7.8).\\nOpenings in the middle cranial fossa are as follows:\\n• Optic canal—This opening is located at the anterior lateral corner of the sella turcica. It provides for passage of\\nthe optic nerve into the orbit.\\n• Superior orbital fissure—This large, irregular opening into the posterior orbit is located on the anterior wall of\\nthe middle cranial fossa, lateral to the optic canal and under the projecting margin of the lesser wing of the\\nsphenoid bone. Nerves to the eyeball and associated muscles, and sensory nerves to the forehead pass through\\nthis opening.\\n7.2 • The Skull 245'),\n",

The branching pattern of this artery\\nforms readily visible grooves on the internal surface of the skull and these grooves can be traced back to their\\norigin at the foramen spinosum.\\n• Carotid canal—This is the zig-zag passageway through which a major artery to the brain enters the skull. The\\nentrance to the carotid canal is located on the inferior aspect of the skull, anteromedial to the styloid process\\n(see Figure 7.8a). From here, the canal runs anteromedially within the bony base of the skull. Just above the\\nforamen lacerum, the carotid canal opens into the middle cranial cavity, near the posterior-lateral base of the\\nsella turcica.\\n• Foramen lacerum—This irregular opening is located in the base of the skull, immediately inferior to the exit of\\nthe carotid canal. This opening is an artifact of the dry skull, because in life it is completely filled with cartilage.\\nAll the openings of the skull that provide for passage of nerves or blood vessels have smooth margins; the word\\nlacerum (“ragged” or “torn”) tells us that this opening has ragged edges and thus nothing passes through it.\\nPosterior Cranial Fossa\\nThe posterior cranial fossa is the most posterior and deepest portion of the cranial cavity. It contains the cerebellum\\nof the brain. The posterior fossa is bounded anteriorly by the petrous ridges, while the occipital bone forms the floor\\nand posterior wall. It is divided at the midline by the large foramen magnum (“great aperture”), the opening that\\nprovides for passage of the spinal cord.\\nLocated on the medial wall of the petrous ridge in the posterior cranial fossa is the internal acoustic meatus (see\\nFigure 7.11). This opening provides for passage of the nerve from the hearing and equilibrium organs of the inner\\near, and the nerve that supplies the muscles of the face. Located at the anterior-lateral margin of the foramen\\nmagnum is the hypoglossal canal. These emerge on the inferior aspect of the skull at the base of the occipital\\ncondyle and provide passage for an important nerve to the tongue.\\nImmediately inferior to the internal acoustic meatus is the large, irregularly shaped jugular foramen (see Figure\\n7.8a). Several cranial nerves from the brain exit the skull via this opening. It is also the exit point through the base of\\nthe skull for all the venous return blood leaving the brain. The venous structures that carry blood inside the skull\\nform large, curved grooves on the inner walls of the posterior cranial fossa, which terminate at each jugular foramen.\\nParanasal Sinuses\\nThe paranasal sinuses are hollow, air-filled spaces located within certain bones of the skull (Figure 7.18). All of the\\nsinuses communicate with the nasal cavity (paranasal = “next to nasal cavity”) and are lined with nasal mucosa.\\nThey serve to reduce bone mass and thus lighten the skull, and they also add resonance to the voice. This second\\nfeature is most obvious when you have a cold or sinus congestion. These produce swelling of the mucosa and\\nexcess mucus production, which can obstruct the narrow passageways between the sinuses and the nasal cavity,\\ncausing your voice to sound different to yourself and others. This blockage can also allow the sinuses to fill with\\nfluid, with the resulting pressure producing pain and discomfort.\\nThe paranasal sinuses are named for the skull bone that each occupies. The frontal sinus is located just above the\\neyebrows, within the frontal bone (see Figure 7.17). This irregular space may be divided at the midline into bilateral\\nspaces, or these may be fused into a single sinus space. The frontal sinus is the most anterior of the paranasal\\nsinuses. The largest sinus is the maxillary sinus. These are paired and located within the right and left maxillary\\nbones, where they occupy the area just below the orbits. The maxillary sinuses are most commonly involved during\\nsinus infections. Because their connection to the nasal cavity is located high on their medial wall, they are difficult to\\ndrain. The sphenoid sinus is a single, midline sinus. It is located within the body of the sphenoid bone, just anterior\\nand inferior to the sella turcica, thus making it the most posterior of the paranasal sinuses. The lateral aspects of the\\nethmoid bone contain multiple small spaces separated by very thin bony walls. Each of these spaces is called an\\nethmoid air cell.

The vertebral column is\\ncurved, with two primary curvatures (thoracic and sacrococcygeal curves) and two secondary curvatures (cervical and lumbar curves).\\nRegions of the Vertebral Column\\nThe vertebral column originally develops as a series of 33 vertebrae, but this number is eventually reduced to 24\\nvertebrae, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The vertebral column is subdivided into five regions, with the vertebrae in\\neach area named for that region and numbered in descending order. In the neck, there are seven cervical vertebrae,\\neach designated with the letter “C” followed by its number. Superiorly, the C1 vertebra articulates (forms a joint)\\nwith the occipital condyles of the skull. Inferiorly, C1 articulates with the C2 vertebra, and so on. Below these are\\nthe 12 thoracic vertebrae, designated T1–T12. The lower back contains the L1–L5 lumbar vertebrae. The single\\nsacrum, which is also part of the pelvis, is formed by the fusion of five sacral vertebrae. Similarly, the coccyx, or\\ntailbone, results from the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae. However, the sacral and coccygeal fusions do not\\nstart until age 20 and are not completed until middle age.\\nAn interesting anatomical fact is that almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, regardless of body size.\\nThis means that there are large variations in the size of cervical vertebrae, ranging from the very small cervical\\nvertebrae of a shrew to the greatly elongated vertebrae in the neck of a giraffe. In a full-grown giraffe, each cervical\\nvertebra is 11 inches tall.\\nCurvatures of the Vertebral Column\\nThe adult vertebral column does not form a straight line, but instead has four curvatures along its length (see Figure\\n7.20). These curves increase the vertebral column’s strength, flexibility, and ability to absorb shock. When the load\\non the spine is increased, by carrying a heavy backpack for example, the curvatures increase in depth (become more\\ncurved) to accommodate the extra weight. They then spring back when the weight is removed. The four adult\\ncurvatures are classified as either primary or secondary curvatures. Primary curves are retained from the original\\nfetal curvature, while secondary curvatures develop after birth.\\n7.3 • The Vertebral Column 249'),\n",

This can develop when\\nosteoporosis causes weakening and erosion of the anterior portions of the upper thoracic vertebrae, resulting in\\ntheir gradual collapse (Figure 7.22). Lordosis, or swayback, is an excessive anterior curvature of the lumbar\\nregion and is most commonly associated with obesity or late pregnancy. The accumulation of body weight in the\\nabdominal region results an anterior shift in the line of gravity that carries the weight of the body.

Compensatory\\ncurves may also develop in other areas of the vertebral column to help maintain the head positioned over the\\nfeet. Scoliosis is the most common vertebral abnormality among girls.

Watch this\\nvideo (http://openstax.org/l/osteoporosis) to get a better understanding of how thoracic vertebrae may become\\nweakened and may fracture due to this disease. How may vertebral osteoporosis contribute to kyphosis?\\nGeneral Structure of a Vertebra\\nWithin the different regions of the vertebral column, vertebrae vary in size and shape, but they all follow a similar\\nstructural pattern. A typical vertebra will consist of a body, a vertebral arch, and seven processes (Figure 7.23).\\nThe body is the anterior portion of each vertebra and is the part that supports the body weight. Because of this, the\\nvertebral bodies progressively increase in size and thickness going down the vertebral column. The bodies of\\nadjacent vertebrae are separated and strongly united by an intervertebral disc.\\nThe vertebral arch forms the posterior portion of each vertebra. It consists of four parts, the right and left pedicles\\nand the right and left laminae. Each pedicle forms one of the lateral sides of the vertebral arch. The pedicles are\\nanchored to the posterior side of the vertebral body. Each lamina forms part of the posterior roof of the vertebral\\narch. The large opening between the vertebral arch and body is the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal\\ncord. In the intact vertebral column, the vertebral foramina of all of the vertebrae align to form the vertebral\\n(spinal) canal, which serves as the bony protection and passageway for the spinal cord down the back. When the\\nvertebrae are aligned together in the vertebral column, notches in the margins of the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae\\ntogether form an intervertebral foramen, the opening through which a spinal nerve exits from the vertebral column\\n(Figure 7.24).\\nSeven processes arise from the vertebral arch. Each paired transverse process projects laterally and arises from\\nthe junction point between the pedicle and lamina. The single spinous process (vertebral spine) projects posteriorly\\nat the midline of the back. The vertebral spines can easily be felt as a series of bumps just under the skin down the\\nmiddle of the back. The transverse and spinous processes serve as important muscle attachment sites. A superior\\narticular process extends or faces upward, and an inferior articular process faces or projects downward on each\\nside of a vertebrae. The paired superior articular processes of one vertebra join with the corresponding paired\\ninferior articular processes from the next higher vertebra. These junctions form slightly moveable joints between the\\nadjacent vertebrae. The shape and orientation of the articular processes vary in different regions of the vertebral\\ncolumn and play a major role in determining the type and range of motion available in each region.\\nlumbar region of the vertebral column.\\nFIGURE 7.22 Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is an age-related disorder that causes the gradual loss of bone density and strength.\\nWhen the thoracic vertebrae are affected, there can be a gradual collapse of the vertebrae.

Arising from the vertebral arch are the transverse, spinous, superior articular, and inferior articular processes.\\nThe vertebral foramen provides for passage of the spinal cord. Each spinal nerve exits through an intervertebral foramen, located between\\nadjacent vertebrae. Intervertebral discs unite the bodies of adjacent vertebrae.\\nFIGURE 7.24 Intervertebral Disc The bodies of adjacent vertebrae are separated and united by an intervertebral disc, which provides\\npadding and allows for movements between adjacent vertebrae. The disc consists of a fibrous outer layer called the anulus fibrosus and a\\ngel-like center called the nucleus pulposus. The intervertebral foramen is the opening formed between adjacent vertebrae for the exit of a\\nspinal nerve.\\nRegional Modifications of Vertebrae\\nIn addition to the general characteristics of a typical vertebra described above, vertebrae also display characteristic\\nsize and structural features that vary between the different vertebral column regions. Thus, cervical vertebrae are\\nsmaller than lumbar vertebrae due to differences in the proportion of body weight that each supports. Thoracic\\nvertebrae have sites for rib attachment, and the vertebrae that give rise to the sacrum and coccyx have fused\\ntogether into single bones.\\nCervical Vertebrae\\nTypical cervical vertebrae, such as C4 or C5, have several characteristic features that differentiate them from\\nthoracic or lumbar vertebrae (Figure 7.25). Cervical vertebrae have a small body, reflecting the fact that they carry\\nthe least amount of body weight. Cervical vertebrae usually have a bifid (Y-shaped) spinous process. The spinous\\nprocesses of the C3–C6 vertebrae are short, but the spine of C7 is much longer. You can find these vertebrae by\\nrunning your finger down the midline of the posterior neck until you encounter the prominent C7 spine located at the\\nbase of the neck. The transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae are sharply curved (U-shaped) to allow for\\npassage of the cervical spinal nerves. Each transverse process also has an opening called the transverse foramen.\\nAn important artery that supplies the brain ascends up the neck by passing through these openings.

It is formed by the fusion of five sacral\\nvertebrae, a process that does not begin until after the age of 20. On the anterior surface of the older adult sacrum,\\nthe lines of vertebral fusion can be seen as four transverse ridges. On the posterior surface, running down the\\nmidline, is the median sacral crest, a bumpy ridge that is the remnant of the fused spinous processes (median =\\n“midline”; while medial = “toward, but not necessarily at, the midline”). Similarly, the fused transverse processes of\\nthe sacral vertebrae form the lateral sacral crest.\\nThe sacral promontory is the anterior lip of the superior base of the sacrum. Lateral to this is the roughened\\nauricular surface, which joins with the ilium portion of the hipbone to form the immobile sacroiliac joints of the\\npelvis. Passing inferiorly through the sacrum is a bony tunnel called the sacral canal, which terminates at the sacral\\nhiatus near the inferior tip of the sacrum. The anterior and posterior surfaces of the sacrum have a series of paired\\nopenings called sacral foramina (singular = foramen) that connect to the sacral canal. Each of these openings is\\ncalled a posterior (dorsal) sacral foramen or anterior (ventral) sacral foramen. These openings allow for the\\nanterior and posterior branches of the sacral spinal nerves to exit the sacrum. The superior articular process of the\\nsacrum, one of which is found on either side of the superior opening of the sacral canal, articulates with the inferior\\narticular processes from the L5 vertebra.\\nThe coccyx, or tailbone, is derived from the fusion of four very small coccygeal vertebrae (see Figure 7.29).

The coccyx is formed by the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae.\\nIntervertebral Discs and Ligaments of the Vertebral Column\\nThe bodies of adjacent vertebrae are strongly anchored to each other by an intervertebral disc. This structure\\nprovides padding between the bones during weight bearing, and because it can change shape, also allows for\\nmovement between the vertebrae. Although the total amount of movement available between any two adjacent\\nvertebrae is small, when these movements are summed together along the entire length of the vertebral column,\\nlarge body movements can be produced. Ligaments that extend along the length of the vertebral column also\\ncontribute to its overall support and stability.\\nIntervertebral Disc\\nAn intervertebral disc is a fibrocartilaginous pad that fills the gap between adjacent vertebral bodies (see Figure\\n7.24). Each disc is anchored to the bodies of its adjacent vertebrae, thus strongly uniting these. The discs also\\nprovide padding between vertebrae during weight bearing. Because of this, intervertebral discs are thin in the\\ncervical region and thickest in the lumbar region, which carries the most body weight. In total, the intervertebral\\ndiscs account for approximately 25 percent of your body height between the top of the pelvis and the base of the\\nskull. Intervertebral discs are also flexible and can change shape to allow for movements of the vertebral column.\\nEach intervertebral disc consists of two parts. The anulus fibrosus is the tough, fibrous outer layer of the disc. It\\nforms a circle (anulus = “ring” or “circle”) and is firmly anchored to the outer margins of the adjacent vertebral\\nbodies. Inside is the nucleus pulposus, consisting of a softer, more gel-like material. It has a high water content\\nthat serves to resist compression and thus is important for weight bearing. With increasing age, the water content of\\nthe nucleus pulposus gradually declines. This causes the disc to become thinner, decreasing total body height\\nsomewhat, and reduces the flexibility and range of motion of the disc, making bending more difficult.\\nThe gel-like nature of the nucleus pulposus also allows the intervertebral disc to change shape as one vertebra\\nrocks side to side or forward and back in relation to its neighbors during movements of the vertebral column. Thus,\\nbending forward causes compression of the anterior portion of the disc but expansion of the posterior disc. If the\\nposterior anulus fibrosus is weakened due to injury or increasing age, the pressure exerted on the disc when\\nbending forward and lifting a heavy object can cause the nucleus pulposus to protrude posteriorly through the\\nanulus fibrosus, resulting in a herniated disc (“ruptured” or “slipped” disc) (Figure 7.30). The posterior bulging of\\nthe nucleus pulposus can cause compression of a spinal nerve at the point where it exits through the intervertebral\\nforamen, with resulting pain and/or muscle weakness in those body regions supplied by that nerve. The most\\ncommon sites for disc herniation are the L4/L5 or L5/S1 intervertebral discs, which can cause sciatica, a widespread\\npain that radiates from the lower back down the thigh and into the leg. Similar injuries of the C5/C6 or C6/C7\\nintervertebral discs, following forcible hyperflexion of the neck from a collision accident or football injury, can\\nproduce pain in the neck, shoulder, and upper limb.\\n256 7 • Axial Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

How could lifting a heavy object produce pain in a lower limb?\\nLigaments of the Vertebral Column\\nAdjacent vertebrae are united by ligaments that run the length of the vertebral column along both its posterior and\\nanterior aspects (Figure 7.31). These serve to resist excess forward or backward bending movements of the\\nvertebral column, respectively.\\nThe anterior longitudinal ligament runs down the anterior side of the entire vertebral column, uniting the vertebral\\nbodies. It serves to resist excess backward bending of the vertebral column. Protection against this movement is\\nparticularly important in the neck, where extreme posterior bending of the head and neck can stretch or tear this\\nligament, resulting in a painful whiplash injury. Prior to the mandatory installation of seat headrests, whiplash\\ninjuries were common for passengers involved in a rear-end automobile collision.\\nThe supraspinous ligament is located on the posterior side of the vertebral column, where it interconnects the\\nspinous processes of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. This strong ligament supports the vertebral column during\\nforward bending motions. In the posterior neck, where the cervical spinous processes are short, the supraspinous\\nligament expands to become the nuchal ligament (nuchae = “nape” or “back of the neck”). The nuchal ligament is\\nattached to the cervical spinous processes and extends upward and posteriorly to attach to the midline base of the\\nskull, out to the external occipital protuberance. It supports the skull and prevents it from falling forward. This\\nligament is much larger and stronger in four-legged animals such as cows, where the large skull hangs off the front\\nend of the vertebral column. You can easily feel this ligament by first extending your head backward and pressing\\ndown on the posterior midline of your neck. Then tilt your head forward and you will fill the nuchal ligament popping\\nout as it tightens to limit anterior bending of the head and neck.\\nAdditional ligaments are located inside the vertebral canal, next to the spinal cord, along the length of the vertebral\\ncolumn. The posterior longitudinal ligament is found anterior to the spinal cord, where it is attached to the\\nposterior sides of the vertebral bodies. Posterior to the spinal cord is the ligamentum flavum (“yellow ligament”).\\nThis consists of a series of short, paired ligaments, each of which interconnects the lamina regions of adjacent\\nvertebrae. The ligamentum flavum has large numbers of elastic fibers, which have a yellowish color, allowing it to\\nstretch and then pull back.

They treat problems such\\nas neck pain, back pain, joint pain, or headaches. Chiropractors focus on the patient’s overall health and can also\\nprovide counseling related to lifestyle issues, such as diet, exercise, or sleep problems. If needed, they will refer the\\npatient to other medical specialists.\\nChiropractors use a drug-free, hands-on approach for patient diagnosis and treatment. They will perform a physical\\nexam, assess the patient’s posture and spine, and may perform additional diagnostic tests, including taking X-ray\\nimages. They primarily use manual techniques, such as spinal manipulation, to adjust the patient’s spine or other\\njoints. They can recommend therapeutic or rehabilitative exercises, and some also include acupuncture, massage\\ntherapy, or ultrasound as part of the treatment program. In addition to those in general practice, some chiropractors\\nspecialize in sport injuries, neurology, orthopaedics, pediatrics, nutrition, internal disorders, or diagnostic imaging.\\nTo become a chiropractor, students must have 3–4 years of undergraduate education, attend an accredited, four-\\nyear Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree program, and pass a licensure examination to be licensed for practice in\\ntheir state.

It consists of the 12 pairs of ribs with their\\ncostal cartilages and the sternum (Figure 7.32). The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae\\n(T1–T12). The thoracic cage protects the heart and lungs.\\nFIGURE 7.32 Thoracic Cage The thoracic cage is formed by the (a) sternum and (b) 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages. The ribs\\nare anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The ribs are\\nclassified as true ribs (1–7) and false ribs (8–12). The last two pairs of false ribs are also known as floating ribs (11–12).\\nSternum\\nThe sternum is the elongated bony structure that anchors the anterior thoracic cage. It consists of three parts: the\\nmanubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The manubrium is the wider, superior portion of the sternum. The top of the\\nmanubrium has a shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular (suprasternal) notch. This can be easily felt at the\\nanterior base of the neck, between the medial ends of the clavicles. The clavicular notch is the shallow depression\\nlocated on either side at the superior-lateral margins of the manubrium. This is the site of the sternoclavicular joint,\\nbetween the sternum and clavicle. The first ribs also attach to the manubrium.\\nThe elongated, central portion of the sternum is the body. The manubrium and body join together at the sternal\\nangle, so called because the junction between these two components is not flat, but forms a slight bend. The\\nsecond rib attaches to the sternum at the sternal angle. Since the first rib is hidden behind the clavicle, the second\\nrib is the highest rib that can be identified by palpation. Thus, the sternal angle and second rib are important\\nlandmarks for the identification and counting of the lower ribs. Ribs 3–7 attach to the sternal body.\\nThe inferior tip of the sternum is the xiphoid process.

The ribs are numbered 1–12 in accordance with the thoracic vertebrae.\\nParts of a Typical Rib\\nThe posterior end of a typical rib is called the head of the rib (see Figure 7.27). This region articulates primarily with\\nthe costal facet located on the body of the same numbered thoracic vertebra and to a lesser degree, with the costal\\nfacet located on the body of the next higher vertebra. Lateral to the head is the narrowed neck of the rib. A small\\nbump on the posterior rib surface is the tubercle of the rib, which articulates with the facet located on the\\ntransverse process of the same numbered vertebra. The remainder of the rib is the body of the rib (shaft). Just\\nlateral to the tubercle is the angle of the rib, the point at which the rib has its greatest degree of curvature. The\\nangles of the ribs form the most posterior extent of the thoracic cage. In the anatomical position, the angles align\\nwith the medial border of the scapula. A shallow costal groove for the passage of blood vessels and a nerve is found\\nalong the inferior margin of each rib.\\nRib Classifications\\nThe bony ribs do not extend anteriorly completely around to the sternum. Instead, each rib ends in a costal\\ncartilage. These cartilages are made of hyaline cartilage and can extend for several inches. Most ribs are then\\nattached, either directly or indirectly, to the sternum via their costal cartilage (see Figure 7.32). The ribs are\\nclassified into three groups based on their relationship to the sternum.\\nRibs 1–7 are classified as true ribs (vertebrosternal ribs). The costal cartilage from each of these ribs attaches\\ndirectly to the sternum. Ribs 8–12 are called false ribs (vertebrochondral ribs). The costal cartilages from these ribs\\ndo not attach directly to the sternum. For ribs 8–10, the costal cartilages are attached to the cartilage of the next\\nhigher rib. Thus, the cartilage of rib 10 attaches to the cartilage of rib 9, rib 9 then attaches to rib 8, and rib 8 is\\nattached to rib 7. The last two false ribs (11–12) are also called floating ribs (vertebral ribs). These are short ribs\\nthat do not attach to the sternum at all. Instead, their small costal cartilages terminate within the musculature of\\nthe lateral abdominal wall.\\n7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial Skeleton\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Discuss the two types of embryonic bone development within the skull\\n• Describe the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage\\nThe axial skeleton begins to form during early embryonic development. However, growth, remodeling, and\\nossification (bone formation) continue for several decades after birth before the adult skeleton is fully formed.\\nKnowledge of the developmental processes that give rise to the skeleton is important for understanding the\\nabnormalities that may arise in skeletal structures.\\nDevelopment of the Skull\\nDuring the third week of embryonic development, a rod-like structure called the notochord develops dorsally along\\nthe length of the embryo. The tissue overlying the notochord enlarges and forms the neural tube, which will give rise\\nto the brain and spinal cord. By the fourth week, mesoderm tissue located on either side of the notochord thickens\\nand separates into a repeating series of block-like tissue structures, each of which is called a somite. As the somites\\nenlarge, each one will split into several parts. The most medial of these parts is called a sclerotome. The\\nsclerotomes consist of an embryonic tissue called mesenchyme, which will give rise to the fibrous connective\\ntissues, cartilages, and bones of the body.\\nThe bones of the skull arise from mesenchyme during embryonic development in two different ways. The first\\nmechanism produces the bones that form the top and sides of the brain case. This involves the local accumulation\\nof mesenchymal cells at the site of the future bone. These cells then differentiate directly into bone producing cells,\\nwhich form the skull bones through the process of intramembranous ossification. As the brain case bones grow in\\nthe fetal skull, they remain separated from each other by large areas of dense connective tissue, each of which is\\ncalled a fontanelle (Figure 7.33). The fontanelles are the soft spots on an infant’s head. They are important during\\nbirth because these areas allow the skull to change shape as it squeezes through the birth canal. After birth, the\\nfontanelles allow for continued growth and expansion of the skull as the brain enlarges. The largest fontanelle is\\n260 7 • Axial Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The fontanelles decrease in size and\\ndisappear by age 2. However, the skull bones remained separated from each other at the sutures, which contain\\ndense fibrous connective tissue that unites the adjacent bones. The connective tissue of the sutures allows for\\ncontinued growth of the skull bones as the brain enlarges during childhood growth.\\nThe second mechanism for bone development in the skull produces the facial bones and floor of the brain case. This\\nalso begins with the localized accumulation of mesenchymal cells. However, these cells differentiate into cartilage\\ncells, which produce a hyaline cartilage model of the future bone. As this cartilage model grows, it is gradually\\nconverted into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. This is a slow process and the cartilage is not\\ncompletely converted to bone until the skull achieves its full adult size.\\nAt birth, the brain case and orbits of the skull are disproportionally large compared to the bones of the jaws and\\nlower face. This reflects the relative underdevelopment of the maxilla and mandible, which lack teeth, and the small\\nsizes of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. During early childhood, the mastoid process enlarges, the two halves\\nof the mandible and frontal bone fuse together to form single bones, and the paranasal sinuses enlarge. The jaws\\nalso expand as the teeth begin to appear. These changes all contribute to the rapid growth and enlargement of the\\nface during childhood.\\nFIGURE 7.33 Newborn Skull The bones of the newborn skull are not fully ossified and are separated by large areas called fontanelles,\\nwhich are filled with fibrous connective tissue. The fontanelles allow for continued growth of the skull after birth. At the time of birth, the\\nfacial bones are small and underdeveloped, and the mastoid process has not yet formed.\\nDevelopment of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage\\nDevelopment of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the\\nnotochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually\\nossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord\\nlargely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this\\ncontributes to the formation of each intervertebral disc.\\nThe ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for\\neach vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage\\nmodel of the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum\\ninitially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth\\nweek of development. The cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing\\nsternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into\\nbone. The manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as\\ncartilage until late in life.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nView this video (http://openstax.org/l/skullbones) to review the two processes that give rise to the bones of the skull\\nand body.

This error in the normal\\ndevelopmental process results in abnormal growth of the skull and deformity of the head. It is produced either by\\ndefects in the ossification process of the skull bones or failure of the brain to properly enlarge. Genetic factors are\\ninvolved, but the underlying cause is unknown. It is a relatively common condition, occurring in approximately\\n1:2000 births, with males being more commonly affected. Primary craniosynostosis involves the early fusion of one\\ncranial suture, whereas complex craniosynostosis results from the premature fusion of several sutures.\\nThe early fusion of a suture in primary craniosynostosis prevents any additional enlargement of the cranial bones\\nand skull along this line. Continued growth of the brain and skull is therefore diverted to other areas of the head,\\ncausing an abnormal enlargement of these regions. For example, the early disappearance of the anterior fontanelle\\nand premature closure of the sagittal suture prevents growth across the top of the head. This is compensated by\\nupward growth by the bones of the lateral skull, resulting in a long, narrow, wedge-shaped head. This condition,\\nknown as scaphocephaly, accounts for approximately 50 percent of craniosynostosis abnormalities. Although the\\nskull is misshapen, the brain still has adequate room to grow and thus there is no accompanying abnormal\\nneurological development.\\nIn cases of complex craniosynostosis, several sutures close prematurely. The amount and degree of skull deformity\\nis determined by the location and extent of the sutures involved. This results in more severe constraints on skull\\ngrowth, which can alter or impede proper brain growth and development.\\nCases of craniosynostosis are usually treated with surgery. A team of physicians will open the skull along the fused\\nsuture, which will then allow the skull bones to resume their growth in this area.

It serves to\\nsupport the body, protect the brain and other internal\\norgans, and provides a rigid structure upon which\\nmuscles can pull to generate body movements. It also\\nstores fat and the tissue responsible for the production\\nof blood cells. The skeleton is subdivided into two\\nparts. The axial skeleton forms a vertical axis that\\nincludes the head, neck, back, and chest. It has 80\\nbones and consists of the skull, vertebral column, and\\nthoracic cage. The adult vertebral column consists of\\n24 vertebrae plus the sacrum and coccyx. The thoracic\\ncage is formed by 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum. The\\nappendicular skeleton consists of 126 bones in the\\nadult and includes all of the bones of the upper and\\nlower limbs plus the bones that anchor each limb to\\nthe axial skeleton.\\n7.2 The Skull\\nThe skull consists of the brain case and the facial\\nbones. The brain case surrounds and protects the\\nbrain, which occupies the cranial cavity inside the skull.\\nIt consists of the rounded calvaria and a complex base.\\nThe brain case is formed by eight bones, the paired\\nparietal and temporal bones plus the unpaired frontal,\\noccipital, sphenoid, and ethmoid bones. The narrow\\ngap between the bones is filled with dense, fibrous\\nconnective tissue that unites the bones. The sagittal\\nsuture joins the right and left parietal bones. The\\ncoronal suture joins the parietal bones to the frontal\\nbone, the lambdoid suture joins them to the occipital\\nbone, and the squamous suture joins them to the\\ntemporal bone.\\nThe facial bones support the facial structures and form\\nthe upper and lower jaws. These consist of 14 bones,\\nwith the paired maxillary, palatine, zygomatic, nasal,\\nlacrimal, and inferior conchae bones and the unpaired\\n7 • Chapter Review 267'),\n",

The ethmoid bone also\\ncontributes to the formation of facial structures. The\\nmaxilla forms the upper jaw and the mandible forms\\nthe lower jaw. The maxilla also forms the larger\\nanterior portion of the hard palate, which is completed\\nby the smaller palatine bones that form the posterior\\nportion of the hard palate.\\nThe floor of the cranial cavity increases in depth from\\nfront to back and is divided into three cranial fossae.\\nThe anterior cranial fossa is located between the\\nfrontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. A\\nsmall area of the ethmoid bone, consisting of the crista\\ngalli and cribriform plates, is located at the midline of\\nthis fossa. The middle cranial fossa extends from the\\nlesser wing of the sphenoid bone to the petrous ridge\\n(petrous portion of temporal bone). The right and left\\nsides are separated at the midline by the sella turcica,\\nwhich surrounds the shallow hypophyseal fossa.\\nOpenings through the skull in the floor of the middle\\nfossa include the optic canal and superior orbital\\nfissure, which open into the posterior orbit, the\\nforamen rotundum, foramen ovale, and foramen\\nspinosum, and the exit of the carotid canal with its\\nunderlying foramen lacerum. The deep posterior\\ncranial fossa extends from the petrous ridge to the\\noccipital bone. Openings here include the large\\nforamen magnum, plus the internal acoustic meatus,\\njugular foramina, and hypoglossal canals. Additional\\nopenings located on the external base of the skull\\ninclude the stylomastoid foramen and the entrance to\\nthe carotid canal.\\nThe anterior skull has the orbits that house the\\neyeballs and associated muscles. The walls of the orbit\\nare formed by contributions from seven bones: the\\nfrontal, zygomatic, maxillary, palatine, ethmoid,\\nlacrimal, and sphenoid. Located at the superior margin\\nof the orbit is the supraorbital foramen, and below the\\norbit is the infraorbital foramen. The mandible has two\\nopenings, the mandibular foramen on its inner surface\\nand the mental foramen on its external surface near\\nthe chin. The nasal conchae are bony projections from\\nthe lateral walls of the nasal cavity. The large inferior\\nnasal concha is an independent bone, while the middle\\nand superior conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone.\\nThe nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate\\nof the ethmoid bone, the vomer bone, and the septal\\ncartilage. The paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces\\nlocated within the frontal, maxillary, sphenoid, and\\nethmoid bones.\\nOn the lateral skull, the zygomatic arch consists of two\\nparts, the temporal process of the zygomatic bone\\nanteriorly and the zygomatic process of the temporal\\nbone posteriorly. The temporal fossa is the shallow\\nspace located on the lateral skull above the level of the\\nzygomatic arch. The infratemporal fossa is located\\nbelow the zygomatic arch and deep to the ramus of the\\nmandible.\\nThe hyoid bone is located in the upper neck and does\\nnot join with any other bone. It is held in position by\\nmuscles and serves to support the tongue above, the\\nlarynx below, and the pharynx posteriorly.\\n7.3 The Vertebral Column\\nThe vertebral column forms the neck and back. The\\nvertebral column originally develops as 33 vertebrae,\\nbut is eventually reduced to 24 vertebrae, plus the\\nsacrum and coccyx. The vertebrae are divided into the\\ncervical region (C1–C7 vertebrae), the thoracic region\\n(T1–T12 vertebrae), and the lumbar region (L1–L5\\nvertebrae). The sacrum arises from the fusion of five\\nsacral vertebrae and the coccyx from the fusion of four\\nsmall coccygeal vertebrae. The vertebral column has\\nfour curvatures, the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and\\nsacrococcygeal curves. The thoracic and\\nsacrococcygeal curves are primary curves retained\\nfrom the original fetal curvature. The cervical and\\nlumbar curves develop after birth and thus are\\nsecondary curves. The cervical curve develops as the\\ninfant begins to hold up the head, and the lumbar curve\\nappears with standing and walking.\\nA typical vertebra consists of an enlarged anterior\\nportion called the body, which provides weight-bearing\\nsupport. Attached posteriorly to the body is a vertebral\\narch, which surrounds and defines the vertebral\\nforamen for passage of the spinal cord. The vertebral\\narch consists of the pedicles, which attach to the\\nvertebral body, and the laminae, which come together\\nto form the roof of the arch. Arising from the vertebral\\narch are the laterally projecting transverse processes\\nand the posteriorly oriented spinous process. The\\nsuperior articular processes project upward, where\\nthey articulate with the downward projecting inferior\\narticular processes of the next higher vertebrae.\\nA typical cervical vertebra has a small body, a bifid (Y-\\nshaped) spinous process, and U-shaped transverse\\nprocesses with a transverse foramen. In addition to\\nthese characteristics, the axis (C2 vertebra) also has\\nthe dens projecting upward from the vertebral body.\\nThe atlas (C1 vertebra) differs from the other cervical\\nvertebrae in that it does not have a body, but instead\\nconsists of bony ring formed by the anterior and\\nposterior arches. The atlas articulates with the dens\\nfrom the axis. A typical thoracic vertebra is\\ndistinguished by its long, downward projecting spinous\\n268 7 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Thoracic vertebrae also have articulation\\nfacets on the body and transverse processes for\\nattachment of the ribs. Lumbar vertebrae support the\\ngreatest amount of body weight and thus have a large,\\nthick body. They also have a short, blunt spinous\\nprocess. The sacrum is triangular in shape. The median\\nsacral crest is formed by the fused vertebral spinous\\nprocesses and the lateral sacral crest is derived from\\nthe fused transverse processes. Anterior (ventral) and\\nposterior (dorsal) sacral foramina allow branches of the\\nsacral spinal nerves to exit the sacrum. The auricular\\nsurfaces are articulation sites on the lateral sacrum\\nthat anchor the sacrum to the hipbones to form the\\npelvis. The coccyx is small and derived from the fusion\\nof four small vertebrae.\\nThe intervertebral discs fill in the gaps between the\\nbodies of adjacent vertebrae. They provide strong\\nattachments and padding between the vertebrae. The\\nouter, fibrous layer of a disc is called the anulus\\nfibrosus. The gel-like interior is called the nucleus\\npulposus. The disc can change shape to allow for\\nmovement between vertebrae. If the anulus fibrosus is\\nweakened or damaged, the nucleus pulposus can\\nprotrude outward, resulting in a herniated disc.\\nThe anterior longitudinal ligament runs along the full\\nlength of the anterior vertebral column, uniting the\\nvertebral bodies. The supraspinous ligament is located\\nposteriorly and interconnects the spinous processes of\\nthe thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. In the neck, this\\nligament expands to become the nuchal ligament. The\\nnuchal ligament is attached to the cervical spinous\\nprocesses and superiorly to the base of the skull, out to\\nthe external occipital protuberance. The posterior\\nlongitudinal ligament runs within the vertebral canal\\nand unites the posterior sides of the vertebral bodies.\\nThe ligamentum flavum unites the lamina of adjacent\\nvertebrae.\\n7.4 The Thoracic Cage\\nThe thoracic cage protects the heart and lungs. It is\\ncomposed of 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages\\nand the sternum. The ribs are anchored posteriorly to\\nthe 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the\\nmanubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The\\nmanubrium and body are joined at the sternal angle,\\nwhich is also the site for attachment of the second ribs.\\nRibs are flattened, curved bones and are numbered\\n1–12. Posteriorly, the head of the rib articulates with\\nthe costal facets located on the bodies of thoracic\\nvertebrae and the rib tubercle articulates with the facet\\nlocated on the vertebral transverse process. The angle\\nof the ribs forms the most posterior portion of the\\nthoracic cage. The costal groove in the inferior margin\\nof each rib carries blood vessels and a nerve.\\nAnteriorly, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. True ribs\\n(1–7) attach directly to the sternum via their costal\\ncartilage. The false ribs (8–12) either attach to the\\nsternum indirectly or not at all. Ribs 8–10 have their\\ncostal cartilages attached to the cartilage of the next\\nhigher rib. The floating ribs (11–12) are short and do\\nnot attach to the sternum or to another rib.\\n7.5 Embryonic Development of the Axial\\nSkeleton\\nFormation of the axial skeleton begins during early\\nembryonic development with the appearance of the\\nrod-like notochord along the dorsal length of the early\\nembryo. Repeating, paired blocks of tissue called\\nsomites then appear along either side of notochord. As\\nthe somites grow, they split into parts, one of which is\\ncalled a sclerotome. This consists of mesenchyme, the\\nembryonic tissue that will become the bones,\\ncartilages, and connective tissues of the body.\\nMesenchyme in the head region will produce the bones\\nof the skull via two different mechanisms. The bones of\\nthe brain case arise via intramembranous ossification\\nin which embryonic mesenchyme tissue converts\\ndirectly into bone. At the time of birth, these bones are\\nseparated by fontanelles, wide areas of fibrous\\nconnective tissue. As the bones grow, the fontanelles\\nare reduced to sutures, which allow for continued\\ngrowth of the skull throughout childhood. In contrast,\\nthe cranial base and facial bones are produced by the\\nprocess of endochondral ossification, in which\\nmesenchyme tissue initially produces a hyaline\\ncartilage model of the future bone. The cartilage model\\nallows for growth of the bone and is gradually\\nconverted into bone over a period of many years.\\nThe vertebrae, ribs, and sternum also develop via\\nendochondral ossification. Mesenchyme accumulates\\naround the notochord and produces hyaline cartilage\\nmodels of the vertebrae. The notochord largely\\ndisappears, but remnants of the notochord contribute\\nto formation of the intervertebral discs. In the thorax\\nregion, a portion of the vertebral cartilage model splits\\noff to form the ribs. These then become attached\\nanteriorly to the developing cartilage model of the\\nsternum. Growth of the cartilage models for the\\nvertebrae, ribs, and sternum allow for enlargement of\\nthe thoracic cage during childhood and adolescence.\\nThe cartilage models gradually undergo ossification\\nand are converted into bone.\\n7 • Chapter Review 269'),\n",

The adult axial skeleton\\nconsists of 80 bones that form the head and body trunk. Attached to this are the limbs, whose 126 bones constitute\\nthe appendicular skeleton. These bones are divided into two groups: the bones that are located within the limbs\\nthemselves, and the girdle bones that attach the limbs to the axial skeleton. The bones of the shoulder region form\\nthe pectoral girdle, which anchors the upper limb to the thoracic cage of the axial skeleton. The lower limb is\\nattached to the vertebral column by the pelvic girdle.\\nBecause of our upright stance, different functional demands are placed upon the upper and lower limbs. Thus, the\\nbones of the lower limbs are adapted for weight-bearing support and stability, as well as for body locomotion via\\nwalking or running. In contrast, our upper limbs are not required for these functions. Instead, our upper limbs are\\nhighly mobile and can be utilized for a wide variety of activities. The large range of upper limb movements, coupled\\nwith the ability to easily manipulate objects with our hands and opposable thumbs, has allowed humans to\\nconstruct the modern world in which we live.\\n8.1 The Pectoral Girdle\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the bones that form the pectoral girdle\\n• List the functions of the pectoral girdle\\nThe appendicular skeleton includes all of the limb bones, plus the bones that unite each limb with the axial skeleton\\nFigure 8.1 Dancer The appendicular skeleton consists of the upper and lower limb bones, the bones of the hands and feet, and the bones\\nthat anchor the limbs to the axial skeleton.

It is supported by the clavicle and\\narticulates with the humerus (arm bone) to form the shoulder joint. The scapula is a flat, triangular-shaped bone\\nwith a prominent ridge running across its posterior surface. This ridge extends out laterally, where it forms the bony\\ntip of the shoulder and joins with the lateral end of the clavicle. By following along the clavicle, you can palpate out\\nto the bony tip of the shoulder, and from there, you can move back across your posterior shoulder to follow the ridge\\nof the scapula.

This allows for\\nthe extensive mobility of the entire pectoral girdle, which in turn enhances movements of the shoulder and upper\\nlimb.\\nClavicle\\nThe clavicle is the only long bone that lies in a horizontal position in the body (see Figure 8.3).

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 291}, page_content='several important functions. First, anchored by muscles from above, it serves as a strut that extends laterally to\\nsupport the scapula. This in turn holds the shoulder joint superiorly and laterally from the body trunk, allowing for\\nmaximal freedom of motion for the upper limb. The clavicle also transmits forces acting on the upper limb to the\\nsternum and axial skeleton. Finally, it serves to protect the underlying nerves and blood vessels as they pass\\nbetween the trunk of the body and the upper limb.\\nThe clavicle has three regions: the medial end, the lateral end, and the shaft. The medial end, known as the sternal\\nend of the clavicle, has a triangular shape and articulates with the manubrium portion of the sternum. This forms\\nthe sternoclavicular joint, which is the only bony articulation between the pectoral girdle of the upper limb and the\\naxial skeleton. This joint allows considerable mobility, enabling the clavicle and scapula to move in upward/\\ndownward and anterior/posterior directions during shoulder movements. The sternoclavicular joint is indirectly\\nsupported by the costoclavicular ligament (costo- = “rib”), which spans the sternal end of the clavicle and the\\nunderlying first rib. The lateral or acromial end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapula, the\\nportion of the scapula that forms the bony tip of the shoulder. There are some sex differences in the morphology of\\nthe clavicle. In females, the clavicle tends to be shorter, thinner, and less curved. In males, the clavicle is heavier\\nand longer, and has a greater curvature and rougher surfaces where muscles attach, features that are more\\npronounced in manual workers.\\nThe clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. Such breaks often occur because of the force exerted\\non the clavicle when a person falls onto their outstretched arms, or when the lateral shoulder receives a strong\\nblow. Because the sternoclavicular joint is strong and rarely dislocated, excessive force results in the breaking of the\\nclavicle, usually between the middle and lateral portions of the bone. If the fracture is complete, the shoulder and\\nlateral clavicle fragment will drop due to the weight of the upper limb, causing the person to support the sagging\\nlimb with their other hand. Muscles acting across the shoulder will also pull the shoulder and lateral clavicle\\nanteriorly and medially, causing the clavicle fragments to override. The clavicle overlies many important blood\\nvessels and nerves for the upper limb, but fortunately, due to the anterior displacement of a broken clavicle, these\\nstructures are rarely affected when the clavicle is fractured.\\nScapula\\nThe scapula is also part of the pectoral girdle and thus plays an important role in anchoring the upper limb to the\\nbody. The scapula is located on the posterior side of the shoulder. It is surrounded by muscles on both its anterior\\n(deep) and posterior (superficial) sides, and thus does not articulate with the ribs of the thoracic cage.\\nThe scapula has several important landmarks (Figure 8.4). The three margins or borders of the scapula, named for\\ntheir positions within the body, are the superior border of the scapula, the medial border of the scapula, and the\\nlateral border of the scapula. The suprascapular notch is located lateral to the midpoint of the superior border.\\nThe corners of the triangular scapula, at either end of the medial border, are the superior angle of the scapula,\\nlocated between the medial and superior borders, and the inferior angle of the scapula, located between the\\nmedial and lateral borders. The inferior angle is the most inferior portion of the scapula, and is particularly important\\nbecause it serves as the attachment point for several powerful muscles involved in shoulder and upper limb\\nmovements. The remaining corner of the scapula, between the superior and lateral borders, is the location of the\\nglenoid cavity (glenoid fossa). This shallow depression articulates with the humerus bone of the arm to form the\\nglenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). The small bony bumps located immediately above and below the glenoid cavity\\nare the supraglenoid tubercle and the infraglenoid tubercle, respectively. These provide attachments for muscles\\nof the arm.\\n276 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Toward the lateral end of the superior border, between the\\nsuprascapular notch and glenoid cavity, is the hook-like coracoid process (coracoid = “shaped like a crow’s beak”).\\nThis process projects anteriorly and curves laterally. At the shoulder, the coracoid process is located inferior to the\\nlateral end of the clavicle. It is anchored to the clavicle by a strong ligament, and serves as the attachment site for\\nmuscles of the anterior chest and arm. On the posterior aspect, the spine of the scapula is a long and prominent\\nridge that runs across its upper portion. Extending laterally from the spine is a flattened and expanded region called\\nthe acromion or acromial process. The acromion forms the bony tip of the superior shoulder region and articulates\\nwith the lateral end of the clavicle, forming the acromioclavicular joint (see Figure 8.3). Together, the clavicle,\\nacromion, and spine of the scapula form a V-shaped bony line that provides for the attachment of neck and back\\nmuscles that act on the shoulder, as well as muscles that pass across the shoulder joint to act on the arm.\\nThe scapula has three depressions, each of which is called a fossa (plural = fossae). Two of these are found on the\\nposterior scapula, above and below the scapular spine. Superior to the spine is the narrow supraspinous fossa, and\\ninferior to the spine is the broad infraspinous fossa. The anterior (deep) surface of the scapula forms the broad\\nsubscapular fossa. All of these fossae provide large surface areas for the attachment of muscles that cross the\\nshoulder joint to act on the humerus.\\nThe acromioclavicular joint transmits forces from the upper limb to the clavicle. The ligaments around this joint are\\nrelatively weak. A hard fall onto the elbow or outstretched hand can stretch or tear the acromioclavicular ligaments,\\nresulting in a moderate injury to the joint. However, the primary support for the acromioclavicular joint comes from a\\nvery strong ligament called the coracoclavicular ligament (see Figure 8.3). This connective tissue band anchors the\\ncoracoid process of the scapula to the inferior surface of the acromial end of the clavicle and thus provides\\nimportant indirect support for the acromioclavicular joint. Following a strong blow to the lateral shoulder, such as\\nwhen a hockey player is driven into the boards, a complete dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint can result. In\\nthis case, the acromion is thrust under the acromial end of the clavicle, resulting in ruptures of both the\\nacromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments. The scapula then separates from the clavicle, with the weight of\\nthe upper limb pulling the shoulder downward. This dislocation injury of the acromioclavicular joint is known as a\\n“shoulder separation” and is common in contact sports such as hockey, football, or martial arts.\\n8.2 Bones of the Upper Limb\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the divisions of the upper limb and describe the bones in each region\\n• List the bones and bony landmarks that articulate at each joint of the upper limb\\n8.2 • Bones of the Upper Limb 277'),\n",

The humerus is the single bone of the upper arm, and the\\nulna (medially) and the radius (laterally) are the paired bones of the forearm. The base of the hand contains eight\\nbones, each called a carpal bone, and the palm of the hand is formed by five bones, each called a metacarpal bone.\\nThe fingers and thumb contain a total of 14 bones, each of which is a phalanx bone of the hand.\\nHumerus\\nThe humerus is the single bone of the upper arm region (Figure 8.5). At its proximal end is the head of the humerus.\\nThis is the large, round, smooth region that faces medially. The head articulates with the glenoid cavity of the\\nscapula to form the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. The margin of the smooth area of the head is the anatomical\\nneck of the humerus. Located on the lateral side of the proximal humerus is an expanded bony area called the\\ngreater tubercle. The smaller lesser tubercle of the humerus is found on the anterior aspect of the humerus.

The more medial of these areas is the trochlea, a spindle- or pulley-shaped region (trochlea =\\n“pulley”), which articulates with the ulna bone. Immediately lateral to the trochlea is the capitulum (“small head”),\\na knob-like structure located on the anterior surface of the distal humerus. The capitulum articulates with the radius\\nbone of the forearm. Just above these bony areas are two small depressions. These spaces accommodate the\\nforearm bones when the elbow is fully bent (flexed). Superior to the trochlea is the coronoid fossa, which receives\\nthe coronoid process of the ulna, and above the capitulum is the radial fossa, which receives the head of the radius\\nwhen the elbow is flexed. Similarly, the posterior humerus has the olecranon fossa, a larger depression that\\nreceives the olecranon process of the ulna when the forearm is fully extended.\\nUlna\\nThe ulna is the medial bone of the forearm. It runs parallel to the radius, which is the lateral bone of the forearm\\n(Figure 8.6). The proximal end of the ulna resembles a crescent wrench with its large, C-shaped trochlear notch.\\nThis region articulates with the trochlea of the humerus as part of the elbow joint. The inferior margin of the\\ntrochlear notch is formed by a prominent lip of bone called the coronoid process of the ulna. Just below this on the\\nanterior ulna is a roughened area called the ulnar tuberosity. To the lateral side and slightly inferior to the trochlear\\nnotch is a small, smooth area called the radial notch of the ulna. This area is the site of articulation between the\\nproximal radius and the ulna, forming the proximal radioulnar joint. The posterior and superior portions of the\\nproximal ulna make up the olecranon process, which forms the bony tip of the elbow.\\nFIGURE 8.6 Ulna and Radius The ulna is located on the medial side of the forearm, and the radius is on the lateral side.

This is the line of attachment for the interosseous membrane of the forearm, a sheet of dense connective\\ntissue that unites the ulna and radius bones. The small, rounded area that forms the distal end is the head of the\\nulna. Projecting from the posterior side of the ulnar head is the styloid process of the ulna, a short bony projection.\\nThis serves as an attachment point for a connective tissue structure that unites the distal ends of the ulna and\\nradius.\\nIn the anatomical position, with the elbow fully extended and the palms facing forward, the arm and forearm do not\\nform a straight line. Instead, the forearm deviates laterally by 5–15 degrees from the line of the arm. This deviation\\nis called the carrying angle. It allows the forearm and hand to swing freely or to carry an object without hitting the\\nhip. The carrying angle is larger in females to accommodate their wider pelvis.\\nRadius\\nThe radius runs parallel to the ulna, on the lateral (thumb) side of the forearm (see Figure 8.6). The head of the\\nradius is a disc-shaped structure that forms the proximal end. The small depression on the surface of the head\\narticulates with the capitulum of the humerus as part of the elbow joint, whereas the smooth, outer margin of the\\nhead articulates with the radial notch of the ulna at the proximal radioulnar joint. The neck of the radius is the\\nnarrowed region immediately below the expanded head. Inferior to this point on the medial side is the radial\\ntuberosity, an oval-shaped, bony protuberance that serves as a muscle attachment point. The shaft of the radius is\\nslightly curved and has a small ridge along its medial side. This ridge forms the interosseous border of the radius,\\nwhich, like the similar border of the ulna, is the line of attachment for the interosseous membrane that unites the\\ntwo forearm bones. The distal end of the radius has a smooth surface for articulation with two carpal bones to form\\nthe radiocarpal joint or wrist joint (Figure 8.7 and Figure 8.8). On the medial side of the distal radius is the ulnar\\nnotch of the radius. This shallow depression articulates with the head of the ulna, which together form the distal\\nradioulnar joint. The lateral end of the radius has a pointed projection called the styloid process of the radius. This\\nprovides attachment for ligaments that support the lateral side of the wrist joint. Compared to the styloid process of\\nthe ulna, the styloid process of the radius projects more distally, thereby limiting the range of movement for lateral\\ndeviations of the hand at the wrist joint.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/fractures) to see how fractures of the distal radius bone can affect the wrist\\njoint. Explain the problems that may occur if a fracture of the distal radius involves the joint surface of the\\nradiocarpal joint of the wrist.\\nCarpal Bones\\nThe wrist and base of the hand are formed by a series of eight small carpal bones (see Figure 8.7). The carpal bones\\nare arranged in two rows, forming a proximal row of four carpal bones and a distal row of four carpal bones. The\\nbones in the proximal row, running from the lateral (thumb) side to the medial side, are the scaphoid (“boat-\\nshaped”), lunate (“moon-shaped”), triquetrum (“three-cornered”), and pisiform (“pea-shaped”) bones. The small,\\nrounded pisiform bone articulates with the anterior surface of the triquetrum bone. The pisiform thus projects\\nanteriorly, where it forms the bony bump that can be felt at the medial base of your hand. The distal bones (lateral to\\nmedial) are the trapezium (“table”), trapezoid (“resembles a table”), capitate (“head-shaped”), and hamate\\n(“hooked bone”) bones. The hamate bone is characterized by a prominent bony extension on its anterior side called\\nthe hook of the hamate bone.\\nA helpful mnemonic for remembering the arrangement of the carpal bones is “So Long To Pinky, Here Comes The\\nThumb.” This mnemonic starts on the lateral side and names the proximal bones from lateral to medial (scaphoid,\\nlunate, triquetrum, pisiform), then makes a U-turn to name the distal bones from medial to lateral (hamate, capitate,\\ntrapezoid, trapezium). Thus, it starts and finishes on the lateral side.\\n280 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A strong ligament called the flexor\\nretinaculum spans the top of this U-shaped area to maintain this grouping of the carpal bones. The flexor\\nretinaculum is attached laterally to the trapezium and scaphoid bones, and medially to the hamate and pisiform\\nbones.

Each hip bone, in turn, is firmly joined to the axial skeleton via its\\nattachment to the sacrum of the vertebral column. The right and left hip bones also converge anteriorly to attach to\\neach other. The bony pelvis is the entire structure formed by the two hip bones, the sacrum, and, attached inferiorly\\nto the sacrum, the coccyx (Figure 8.12).\\nUnlike the bones of the pectoral girdle, which are highly mobile to enhance the range of upper limb movements, the\\nbones of the pelvis are strongly united to each other to form a largely immobile, weight-bearing structure. This is\\nimportant for stability because it enables the weight of the body to be easily transferred laterally from the vertebral\\ncolumn, through the pelvic girdle and hip joints, and into either lower limb whenever the other limb is not bearing\\nweight. Thus, the immobility of the pelvis provides a strong foundation for the upper body as it rests on top of the\\nmobile lower limbs.\\nFIGURE 8.12 Pelvis The pelvic girdle is formed by a single hip bone. The hip bone attaches the lower limb to the axial skeleton through\\nits articulation with the sacrum. The right and left hip bones, plus the sacrum and the coccyx, together form the pelvis.\\nHip Bone\\nThe hip bone, or coxal bone, forms the pelvic girdle portion of the pelvis. The paired hip bones are the large, curved\\nbones that form the lateral and anterior aspects of the pelvis. Each adult hip bone is formed by three separate bones\\nthat fuse together during the late teenage years. These bony components are the ilium, ischium, and pubis (Figure\\n8.13). These names are retained and used to define the three regions of the adult hip bone.\\n8.3 • The Pelvic Girdle and Pelvis 285'),\n",

The ilium forms the large, fan-shaped superior portion, the\\nischium forms the posteroinferior portion, and the pubis forms the anteromedial portion.\\nThe ilium is the fan-like, superior region that forms the largest part of the hip bone. It is firmly united to the sacrum\\nat the largely immobile sacroiliac joint (see Figure 8.12). The ischium forms the posteroinferior region of each hip\\nbone. It supports the body when sitting. The pubis forms the anterior portion of the hip bone. The pubis curves\\nmedially, where it joins to the pubis of the opposite hip bone at a specialized joint called the pubic symphysis.\\nIlium\\nWhen you place your hands on your waist, you can feel the arching, superior margin of the ilium along your waistline\\n(see Figure 8.13). This curved, superior margin of the ilium is the iliac crest. The rounded, anterior termination of\\nthe iliac crest is the anterior superior iliac spine. This important bony landmark can be felt at your anterolateral hip.\\nInferior to the anterior superior iliac spine is a rounded protuberance called the anterior inferior iliac spine. Both of\\nthese iliac spines serve as attachment points for muscles of the thigh. Posteriorly, the iliac crest curves downward to\\nterminate as the posterior superior iliac spine. Muscles and ligaments surround but do not cover this bony\\nlandmark, thus sometimes producing a depression seen as a “dimple” located on the lower back. More inferiorly is\\nthe posterior inferior iliac spine. This is located at the inferior end of a large, roughened area called the auricular\\nsurface of the ilium. The auricular surface articulates with the auricular surface of the sacrum to form the sacroiliac\\njoint. Both the posterior superior and posterior inferior iliac spines serve as attachment points for the muscles and\\nvery strong ligaments that support the sacroiliac joint.\\nThe shallow depression located on the anteromedial (internal) surface of the upper ilium is called the iliac fossa.\\nThe inferior margin of this space is formed by the arcuate line of the ilium, the ridge formed by the pronounced\\nchange in curvature between the upper and lower portions of the ilium. The large, inverted U-shaped indentation\\nlocated on the posterior margin of the lower ilium is called the greater sciatic notch.\\nIschium\\nThe ischium forms the posterolateral portion of the hip bone (see Figure 8.13). The large, roughened area of the\\ninferior ischium is the ischial tuberosity. This serves as the attachment for the posterior thigh muscles and also\\ncarries the weight of the body when sitting. You can feel the ischial tuberosity if you wiggle your pelvis against the\\nseat of a chair. Projecting superiorly and anteriorly from the ischial tuberosity is a narrow segment of bone called the\\nischial ramus. The slightly curved posterior margin of the ischium above the ischial tuberosity is the lesser sciatic\\nnotch. The bony projection separating the lesser sciatic notch and greater sciatic notch is the ischial spine.\\n286 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The enlarged medial portion of the pubis is\\nthe pubic body. Located superiorly on the pubic body is a small bump called the pubic tubercle. The superior\\npubic ramus is the segment of bone that passes laterally from the pubic body to join the ilium. The narrow ridge\\nrunning along the superior margin of the superior pubic ramus is the pectineal line of the pubis.\\nThe pubic body is joined to the pubic body of the opposite hip bone by the pubic symphysis. Extending downward\\nand laterally from the body is the inferior pubic ramus. The pubic arch is the bony structure formed by the pubic\\nsymphysis, and the bodies and inferior pubic rami of the adjacent pubic bones. The inferior pubic ramus extends\\ndownward to join the ischial ramus. Together, these form the single ischiopubic ramus, which extends from the\\npubic body to the ischial tuberosity. The inverted V-shape formed as the ischiopubic rami from both sides come\\ntogether at the pubic symphysis is called the subpubic angle.\\nPelvis\\nThe pelvis consists of four bones: the right and left hip bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx (see Figure 8.12). The\\npelvis has several important functions. Its primary role is to support the weight of the upper body when sitting and\\nto transfer this weight to the lower limbs when standing. It serves as an attachment point for trunk and lower limb\\nmuscles, and also protects the internal pelvic organs. When standing in the anatomical position, the pelvis is tilted\\nanteriorly. In this position, the anterior superior iliac spines and the pubic tubercles lie in the same vertical plane,\\nand the anterior (internal) surface of the sacrum faces forward and downward.\\nThe three areas of each hip bone, the ilium, pubis, and ischium, converge centrally to form a deep, cup-shaped\\ncavity called the acetabulum. This is located on the lateral side of the hip bone and is part of the hip joint. The large\\nopening in the anteroinferior hip bone between the ischium and pubis is the obturator foramen. This space is\\nlargely filled in by a layer of connective tissue and serves for the attachment of muscles on both its internal and\\nexternal surfaces.\\nSeveral ligaments unite the bones of the pelvis (Figure 8.14). The largely immobile sacroiliac joint is supported by a\\npair of strong ligaments that are attached between the sacrum and ilium portions of the hip bone. These are the\\nanterior sacroiliac ligament on the anterior side of the joint and the posterior sacroiliac ligament on the posterior\\nside. Also spanning the sacrum and hip bone are two additional ligaments. The sacrospinous ligament runs from\\nthe sacrum to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament runs from the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity.\\nThese ligaments help to support and immobilize the sacrum as it carries the weight of the body.\\nFIGURE 8.14 Ligaments of the Pelvis The posterior sacroiliac ligament supports the sacroiliac joint. The sacrospinous ligament spans\\nthe sacrum to the ischial spine, and the sacrotuberous ligament spans the sacrum to the ischial tuberosity.

What is\\nthe large opening in the bony pelvis, located between the ischium and pubic regions, and what two parts of the\\npubis contribute to the formation of this opening?\\nThe sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments also help to define two openings on the posterolateral sides of the\\npelvis through which muscles, nerves, and blood vessels for the lower limb exit. The superior opening is the greater\\nsciatic foramen. This large opening is formed by the greater sciatic notch of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the\\nsacrospinous ligament. The smaller, more inferior lesser sciatic foramen is formed by the lesser sciatic notch of the\\nhip bone, together with the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.\\nThe space enclosed by the bony pelvis is divided into two regions (Figure 8.15). The broad, superior region, defined\\nlaterally by the large, fan-like portion of the upper hip bone, is called the greater pelvis (greater pelvic cavity; false\\npelvis). This broad area is occupied by portions of the small and large intestines, and because it is more closely\\nassociated with the abdominal cavity, it is sometimes referred to as the false pelvis. More inferiorly, the narrow,\\nrounded space of the lesser pelvis (lesser pelvic cavity; true pelvis) contains the bladder and other pelvic organs,\\nand thus is also known as the true pelvis. The pelvic brim (also known as the pelvic inlet) forms the superior margin\\nof the lesser pelvis, separating it from the greater pelvis. The pelvic brim is defined by a line formed by the upper\\nmargin of the pubic symphysis anteriorly, and the pectineal line of the pubis, the arcuate line of the ilium, and the\\nsacral promontory (the anterior margin of the superior sacrum) posteriorly. The inferior limit of the lesser pelvic\\ncavity is called the pelvic outlet. This large opening is defined by the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis\\nanteriorly, and the ischiopubic ramus, the ischial tuberosity, the sacrotuberous ligament, and the inferior tip of the\\ncoccyx posteriorly. Because of the anterior tilt of the pelvis, the lesser pelvis is also angled, giving it an\\nanterosuperior (pelvic inlet) to posteroinferior (pelvic outlet) orientation.\\nFIGURE 8.15 Male and Female Pelvis The female pelvis is adapted for childbirth and is broader, with a larger subpubic angle, a\\nrounder pelvic brim, and a wider and more shallow lesser pelvic cavity than the male pelvis.\\nComparison of the Female and Male Pelvis\\nThe differences between the adult female and male pelvis relate to function and body size. In general, the bones of\\nthe male pelvis are thicker and heavier, adapted for support of the male’s heavier physical build and stronger\\nmuscles. The greater sciatic notch of the male hip bone is narrower and deeper than the broader notch of females.\\nBecause the female pelvis is adapted for childbirth, it is wider than the male pelvis, as evidenced by the distance\\nbetween the anterior superior iliac spines (see Figure 8.15). The ischial tuberosities of females are also farther\\napart, which increases the size of the pelvic outlet. Because of this increased pelvic width, the subpubic angle is\\nlarger in females (greater than 80 degrees) than it is in males (less than 70 degrees). The female sacrum is wider,\\nshorter, and less curved, and the sacral promontory projects less into the pelvic cavity, thus giving the female pelvic\\ninlet (pelvic brim) a more rounded or oval shape compared to males. The lesser pelvic cavity of females is also wider\\nand more shallow than the narrower, deeper, and tapering lesser pelvis of males. Because of the obvious differences\\nbetween female and male hip bones, this is the one bone of the body that allows for the most accurate sex\\ndetermination.

A forensic pathologist\\napplies understanding of disease as well as toxins, blood and DNA analysis, firearms and ballistics, and other factors\\nto assess the cause and manner of death. At times, a forensic pathologist will be called to testify under oath in\\nsituations that involve a possible crime. Forensic pathology is a field that has received much media attention on\\ntelevision shows or following a high-profile death.\\nWhile forensic pathologists are responsible for determining whether the cause of someone’s death was natural, by\\nsuicide, accidental, or by homicide, there are times when uncovering the cause of death is more complex, and other\\nskills are needed. Forensic anthropology brings the tools and knowledge of physical anthropology and human\\nosteology (the study of the skeleton) to the task of investigating a death. A forensic anthropologist assists medical\\nand legal professionals in identifying human remains. The science behind forensic anthropology involves the study\\nof archaeological excavation; the examination of hair; an understanding of plants, insects, and footprints; the ability\\nto determine how much time has elapsed since the person died; the analysis of past medical history and toxicology;\\nthe ability to determine whether there are any postmortem injuries or alterations of the skeleton; and the\\nidentification of the decedent (deceased person) using skeletal and dental evidence.\\nDue to the extensive knowledge and understanding of excavation techniques, a forensic anthropologist is an integral\\nand invaluable team member to have on-site when investigating a crime scene, especially when the recovery of\\nhuman skeletal remains is involved. When remains are bought to a forensic anthropologist for examination, they\\nmust first determine whether the remains are in fact human. Once the remains have been identified as belonging to\\na person and not to an animal, the next step is to approximate the individual’s age, sex, race, and height. The\\nforensic anthropologist does not determine the cause of death, but rather provides information to the forensic\\npathologist, who will use all of the data collected to make a final determination regarding the cause of death.\\n8.4 Bones of the Lower Limb\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the divisions of the lower limb and describe the bones of each region\\n• Describe the bones and bony landmarks that articulate at each joint of the lower limb\\n8.4 • Bones of the Lower Limb 289'),\n",

The patella articulates with the patellar surface of the\\nfemur and thus prevents rubbing of the muscle tendon against the distal femur. The patella also lifts the tendon\\naway from the knee joint, which increases the leverage power of the quadriceps femoris muscle as it acts across the\\nknee. The patella does not articulate with the tibia.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/kneesurgery) to watch a virtual knee replacement surgery. The prosthetic knee\\ncomponents must be properly aligned to function properly. How is this alignment ensured?\\nHOME OSTATIC IMB ALANCE S\\nRunner’s Knee\\nRunner’s knee, also known as patellofemoral syndrome, is the most common overuse injury among runners. It is\\nmost frequent in adolescents and young adults, and is more common in females. It often results from excessive\\nrunning, particularly downhill, but may also occur in athletes who do a lot of knee bending, such as jumpers, skiers,\\ncyclists, weight lifters, and soccer players. It is felt as a dull, aching pain around the front of the knee and deep to\\nthe patella. The pain may be felt when walking or running, going up or down stairs, kneeling or squatting, or after\\nsitting with the knee bent for an extended period.\\nPatellofemoral syndrome may be initiated by a variety of causes, including individual variations in the shape and\\nmovement of the patella, a direct blow to the patella, or flat feet or improper shoes that cause excessive turning in\\nor out of the feet or leg. These factors may cause in an imbalance in the muscle pull that acts on the patella,\\nresulting in an abnormal tracking of the patella that allows it to deviate too far toward the lateral side of the patellar\\nsurface on the distal femur.\\nBecause the hips are wider than the knee region, the femur has a diagonal orientation within the thigh, in contrast to\\nthe vertically oriented tibia of the leg (Figure 8.17). The Q-angle is a measure of how far the femur is angled laterally\\naway from vertical. The Q-angle is normally 10–15 degrees, with females typically having a larger Q-angle due to\\ntheir wider pelvis. During extension of the knee, the quadriceps femoris muscle pulls the patella both superiorly and\\nlaterally, with the lateral pull greater in females due to their large Q-angle. This makes females more vulnerable to\\ndeveloping patellofemoral syndrome than males. Normally, the large lip on the lateral side of the patellar surface of\\nthe femur compensates for the lateral pull on the patella, and thus helps to maintain its proper tracking.\\n292 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The fibula does not bear\\nweight. It serves primarily for muscle attachments and thus is largely surrounded by muscles. Only the proximal and\\ndistal ends of the fibula can be palpated.\\nThe head of the fibula is the small, knob-like, proximal end of the fibula. It articulates with the inferior aspect of the\\nlateral tibial condyle, forming the proximal tibiofibular joint. The thin shaft of the fibula has the interosseous\\nborder of the fibula, a narrow ridge running down its medial side for the attachment of the interosseous membrane\\nthat spans the fibula and tibia.

These elongated bones are numbered 1–5,\\nstarting with the medial side of the foot. The first metatarsal bone is shorter and thicker than the others. The second\\nmetatarsal is the longest. The base of the metatarsal bone is the proximal end of each metatarsal bone. These\\narticulate with the cuboid or cuneiform bones. The base of the fifth metatarsal has a large, lateral expansion that\\nprovides for muscle attachments. This expanded base of the fifth metatarsal can be felt as a bony bump at the\\nmidpoint along the lateral border of the foot. The expanded distal end of each metatarsal is the head of the\\nmetatarsal bone. Each metatarsal bone articulates with the proximal phalanx of a toe to form a\\nmetatarsophalangeal joint. The heads of the metatarsal bones also rest on the ground and form the ball (anterior\\nend) of the foot.\\nPhalanges\\nThe toes contain a total of 14 phalanx bones (phalanges), arranged in a similar manner as the phalanges of the\\nfingers (see Figure 8.19). The toes are numbered 1–5, starting with the big toe (hallux). The big toe has two phalanx\\nbones, the proximal and distal phalanges. The remaining toes all have proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. A joint\\nbetween adjacent phalanx bones is called an interphalangeal joint.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nView this link (http://openstax.org/l/bunion) to learn about a bunion, a localized swelling on the medial side of the\\nfoot, next to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, at the base of the big toe. What is a bunion and what type of shoe is\\nmost likely to cause this to develop?\\nArches of the Foot\\nWhen the foot comes into contact with the ground during walking, running, or jumping activities, the impact of the\\nbody weight puts a tremendous amount of pressure and force on the foot. During running, the force applied to each\\nfoot as it contacts the ground can be up to 2.5 times your body weight. The bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles of\\nthe foot absorb this force, thus greatly reducing the amount of shock that is passed superiorly into the lower limb\\nand body. The arches of the foot play an important role in this shock-absorbing ability. When weight is applied to the\\nfoot, these arches will flatten somewhat, thus absorbing energy. When the weight is removed, the arch rebounds,\\ngiving “spring” to the step. The arches also serve to distribute body weight side to side and to either end of the foot.\\nThe foot has a transverse arch, a medial longitudinal arch, and a lateral longitudinal arch (see Figure 8.19). The\\ntransverse arch forms the medial-lateral curvature of the mid-foot. It is formed by the wedge shapes of the\\ncuneiform bones and bases (proximal ends) of the first to fourth metatarsal bones. This arch helps to distribute\\nbody weight from side to side within the foot, thus allowing the foot to accommodate uneven terrain.\\nThe longitudinal arches run down the length of the foot. The lateral longitudinal arch is relatively flat, whereas the\\nmedial longitudinal arch is larger (taller). The longitudinal arches are formed by the tarsal bones posteriorly and the\\nmetatarsal bones anteriorly. These arches are supported at either end, where they contact the ground. Posteriorly,\\nthis support is provided by the calcaneus bone and anteriorly by the heads (distal ends) of the metatarsal bones.\\nThe talus bone, which receives the weight of the body, is located at the top of the longitudinal arches. Body weight is\\n296 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Strong ligaments\\nunite the adjacent foot bones to prevent disruption of the arches during weight bearing. On the bottom of the foot,\\nadditional ligaments tie together the anterior and posterior ends of the arches. These ligaments have elasticity,\\nwhich allows them to stretch somewhat during weight bearing, thus allowing the longitudinal arches to spread. The\\nstretching of these ligaments stores energy within the foot, rather than passing these forces into the leg. Contraction\\nof the foot muscles also plays an important role in this energy absorption. When the weight is removed, the elastic\\nligaments recoil and pull the ends of the arches closer together. This recovery of the arches releases the stored\\nenergy and improves the energy efficiency of walking.\\nStretching of the ligaments that support the longitudinal arches can lead to pain. This can occur in overweight\\nindividuals, with people who have jobs that involve standing for long periods of time (such as a waitress), or walking\\nor running long distances. If stretching of the ligaments is prolonged, excessive, or repeated, it can result in a\\ngradual lengthening of the supporting ligaments, with subsequent depression or collapse of the longitudinal arches,\\nparticularly on the medial side of the foot. This condition is called pes planus (“flat foot” or “fallen arches”).\\n8.5 Development of the Appendicular Skeleton\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the growth and development of the embryonic limb buds\\n• Discuss the appearance of primary and secondary ossification centers\\nEmbryologically, the appendicular skeleton arises from mesenchyme, a type of embryonic tissue that can\\ndifferentiate into many types of tissues, including bone or muscle tissue. Mesenchyme gives rise to the bones of the\\nupper and lower limbs, as well as to the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Development of the limbs begins near the end of\\nthe fourth embryonic week, with the upper limbs appearing first. Thereafter, the development of the upper and\\nlower limbs follows similar patterns, with the lower limbs lagging behind the upper limbs by a few days.\\nLimb Growth\\nEach upper and lower limb initially develops as a small bulge called a limb bud, which appears on the lateral side of\\nthe early embryo. The upper limb bud appears near the end of the fourth week of development, with the lower limb\\nbud appearing shortly after (Figure 8.20).\\nFIGURE 8.20 Embryo at Seven Weeks Limb buds are visible in an embryo at the end of the seventh week of development (embryo\\nderived from an ectopic pregnancy). (credit: Ed Uthman/flickr)\\nInitially, the limb buds consist of a core of mesenchyme covered by a layer of ectoderm. The ectoderm at the end of\\nthe limb bud thickens to form a narrow crest called the apical ectodermal ridge. This ridge stimulates the\\n8.5 • Development of the Appendicular Skeleton 297'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 313}, page_content='underlying mesenchyme to rapidly proliferate, producing the outgrowth of the developing limb. As the limb bud\\nelongates, cells located farther from the apical ectodermal ridge slow their rates of cell division and begin to\\ndifferentiate. In this way, the limb develops along a proximal-to-distal axis.\\nDuring the sixth week of development, the distal ends of the upper and lower limb buds expand and flatten into a\\npaddle shape. This region will become the hand or foot. The wrist or ankle areas then appear as a constriction that\\ndevelops at the base of the paddle. Shortly after this, a second constriction on the limb bud appears at the future\\nsite of the elbow or knee. Within the paddle, areas of tissue undergo cell death, producing separations between the\\ngrowing fingers and toes. Also during the sixth week of development, mesenchyme within the limb buds begins to\\ndifferentiate into hyaline cartilage that will form models of the future limb bones.\\nThe early outgrowth of the upper and lower limb buds initially has the limbs positioned so that the regions that will\\nbecome the palm of the hand or the bottom of the foot are facing medially toward the body, with the future thumb or\\nbig toe both oriented toward the head. During the seventh week of development, the upper limb rotates laterally by\\n90 degrees, so that the palm of the hand faces anteriorly and the thumb points laterally. In contrast, the lower limb\\nundergoes a 90-degree medial rotation, thus bringing the big toe to the medial side of the foot.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this animation (http://openstax.org/l/limbbuds) to follow the development and growth of the upper and lower\\nlimb buds. On what days of embryonic development do these events occur: (a) first appearance of the upper limb\\nbud (limb ridge); (b) the flattening of the distal limb to form the handplate or footplate; and (c) the beginning of limb\\nrotation?\\nOssification of Appendicular Bones\\nAll of the girdle and limb bones, except for the clavicle, develop by the process of endochondral ossification. This\\nprocess begins as the mesenchyme within the limb bud differentiates into hyaline cartilage to form cartilage models\\nfor future bones. By the twelfth week, a primary ossification center will have appeared in the diaphysis (shaft) region\\nof the long bones, initiating the process that converts the cartilage model into bone. A secondary ossification center\\nwill appear in each epiphysis (expanded end) of these bones at a later time, usually after birth. The primary and\\nsecondary ossification centers are separated by the epiphyseal plate, a layer of growing hyaline cartilage. This plate\\nis located between the diaphysis and each epiphysis. It continues to grow and is responsible for the lengthening of\\nthe bone. The epiphyseal plate is retained for many years, until the bone reaches its final, adult size, at which time\\nthe epiphyseal plate disappears and the epiphysis fuses to the diaphysis. (Seek additional content on ossification in\\nthe chapter on bone tissue.)\\nSmall bones, such as the phalanges, will develop only one secondary ossification center and will thus have only a\\nsingle epiphyseal plate. Large bones, such as the femur, will develop several secondary ossification centers, with an\\nepiphyseal plate associated with each secondary center. Thus, ossification of the femur begins at the end of the\\nseventh week with the appearance of the primary ossification center in the diaphysis, which rapidly expands to\\nossify the shaft of the bone prior to birth. Secondary ossification centers develop at later times. Ossification of the\\ndistal end of the femur, to form the condyles and epicondyles, begins shortly before birth. Secondary ossification\\ncenters also appear in the femoral head late in the first year after birth, in the greater trochanter during the fourth\\nyear, and in the lesser trochanter between the ages of 9 and 10 years. Once these areas have ossified, their fusion to\\nthe diaphysis and the disappearance of each epiphyseal plate follow a reversed sequence. Thus, the lesser\\ntrochanter is the first to fuse, doing so at the onset of puberty (around 11 years of age), followed by the greater\\ntrochanter approximately 1 year later. The femoral head fuses between the ages of 14–17 years, whereas the distal\\ncondyles of the femur are the last to fuse, between the ages of 16–19 years. Knowledge of the age at which different\\nepiphyseal plates disappear is important when interpreting radiographs taken of children. Since the cartilage of an\\nepiphyseal plate is less dense than bone, the plate will appear dark in a radiograph image. Thus, a normal\\nepiphyseal plate may be mistaken for a bone fracture.\\nThe clavicle is the one appendicular skeleton bone that does not develop via endochondral ossification. Instead, the\\nclavicle develops through the process of intramembranous ossification. During this process, mesenchymal cells\\ndifferentiate directly into bone-producing cells, which produce the clavicle directly, without first making a cartilage\\n298 8 • The Appendicular Skeleton\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Because of this early production of bone, the clavicle is the first bone of the body to begin ossification, with\\nossification centers appearing during the fifth week of development. However, ossification of the clavicle is not\\ncomplete until age 25.\\nDisorders of the...\\nAppendicular System: Congenital Clubfoot\\nClubfoot, also known as talipes, is a congenital (present at birth) disorder of unknown cause and is the most\\ncommon deformity of the lower limb. It affects the foot and ankle, causing the foot to be twisted inward at a\\nsharp angle, like the head of a golf club (Figure 8.21). Clubfoot has a frequency of about 1 out of every 1,000\\nbirths, and is twice as likely to occur in a male child as in a female child. In 50 percent of cases, both feet are\\naffected.\\nFIGURE 8.21 Clubfoot Clubfoot is a common deformity of the ankle and foot that is present at birth. Most cases are corrected\\nwithout surgery, and affected individuals will grow up to lead normal, active lives. (credit: James W. Hanson)\\nAt birth, children with a clubfoot have the heel turned inward and the anterior foot twisted so that the lateral\\nside of the foot is facing inferiorly, commonly due to ligaments or leg muscles attached to the foot that are\\nshortened or abnormally tight. These pull the foot into an abnormal position, resulting in bone deformities. Other\\nsymptoms may include bending of the ankle that lifts the heel of the foot and an extremely high foot arch. Due to\\nthe limited range of motion in the affected foot, it is difficult to place the foot into the correct position.\\nAdditionally, the affected foot may be shorter than normal, and the calf muscles are usually underdeveloped on\\nthe affected side. Despite the appearance, this is not a painful condition for newborns. However, it must be\\ntreated early to avoid future pain and impaired walking ability.\\nAlthough the cause of clubfoot is idiopathic (unknown), evidence indicates that fetal position within the uterus is\\nnot a contributing factor. Genetic factors are involved, because clubfoot tends to run within families. Cigarette\\nsmoking during pregnancy has been linked to the development of clubfoot, particularly in families with a history\\nof clubfoot.\\nPreviously, clubfoot required extensive surgery. Today, 90 percent of cases are successfully treated without\\nsurgery using new corrective casting techniques. The best chance for a full recovery requires that clubfoot\\ntreatment begin during the first 2 weeks after birth. Corrective casting gently stretches the foot, which is\\nfollowed by the application of a holding cast to keep the foot in the proper position. This stretching and casting is\\nrepeated weekly for several weeks. In severe cases, surgery may also be required, after which the foot typically\\nremains in a cast for 6 to 8 weeks. After the cast is removed following either surgical or nonsurgical treatment,\\nthe child will be required to wear a brace part-time (at night) for up to 4 years. In addition, special exercises will\\nbe prescribed, and the child must also wear special shoes. Close monitoring by the parents and adherence to\\npostoperative instructions are imperative in minimizing the risk of relapse.\\n8.5 • Development of the Appendicular Skeleton 299'),\n",

The clavicle is an anterior bone whose sternal\\nend articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at\\nthe sternoclavicular joint. The sternal end is also\\nanchored to the first rib by the costoclavicular\\nligament. The acromial end of the clavicle articulates\\nwith the acromion of the scapula at the\\nacromioclavicular joint. This end is also anchored to\\nthe coracoid process of the scapula by the\\ncoracoclavicular ligament, which provides indirect\\nsupport for the acromioclavicular joint. The clavicle\\nsupports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces\\nfrom the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the\\nunderlying nerves and blood vessels.\\nThe scapula lies on the posterior aspect of the pectoral\\ngirdle. It mediates the attachment of the upper limb to\\nthe clavicle, and contributes to the formation of the\\nglenohumeral (shoulder) joint. This triangular bone has\\nthree sides called the medial, lateral, and superior\\nborders. The suprascapular notch is located on the\\nsuperior border. The scapula also has three corners,\\ntwo of which are the superior and inferior angles. The\\nthird corner is occupied by the glenoid cavity.\\nPosteriorly, the spine separates the supraspinous and\\ninfraspinous fossae, and then extends laterally as the\\nacromion. The subscapular fossa is located on the\\nanterior surface of the scapula. The coracoid process\\nprojects anteriorly, passing inferior to the lateral end of\\nthe clavicle.\\n8.2 Bones of the Upper Limb\\nEach upper limb is divided into three regions and\\ncontains a total of 30 bones. The upper arm is the\\nregion located between the shoulder and elbow joints.\\nThis area contains the humerus. The proximal humerus\\nconsists of the head, which articulates with the scapula\\nat the glenohumeral joint, the greater and lesser\\ntubercles separated by the intertubercular (bicipital)\\ngroove, and the anatomical and surgical necks. The\\nhumeral shaft has the roughened area of the deltoid\\ntuberosity on its lateral side. The distal humerus is\\nflattened, forming a lateral supracondylar ridge that\\nterminates at the small lateral epicondyle. The medial\\nside of the distal humerus has the large, medial\\nepicondyle. The articulating surfaces of the distal\\nhumerus consist of the trochlea medially and the\\ncapitulum laterally. Depressions on the humerus that\\naccommodate the forearm bones during bending\\n(flexing) and straightening (extending) of the elbow\\ninclude the coronoid fossa, the radial fossa, and the\\nolecranon fossa.\\nThe forearm is the region of the upper limb located\\nbetween the elbow and wrist joints.

The proximal radioulnar joint is\\nthe articulation between the head of the radius and the\\nradial notch of the ulna. The proximal ulna also has the\\nolecranon process, forming an expanded posterior\\nregion, and the coronoid process and ulnar tuberosity\\non its anterior aspect. On the proximal radius, the\\nnarrowed region below the head is the neck; distal to\\nthis is the radial tuberosity. The shaft portions of both\\nthe ulna and radius have an interosseous border,\\nwhereas the distal ends of each bone have a pointed\\nstyloid process. The distal radioulnar joint is found\\nbetween the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch of\\nthe radius. The distal end of the radius articulates with\\nthe proximal carpal bones, but the ulna does not.\\nThe base of the hand is formed by eight carpal bones.\\nThe carpal bones are united into two rows of bones.\\nThe proximal row contains (from lateral to medial) the\\nscaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform bones. The\\nscaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum bones contribute to\\nthe formation of the radiocarpal joint. The distal row of\\ncarpal bones contains (from medial to lateral) the\\nhamate, capitate, trapezoid, and trapezium bones (“So\\nLong To Pinky, Here Comes The Thumb”). The anterior\\nhamate has a prominent bony hook. The proximal and\\ndistal carpal rows articulate with each other at the\\nmidcarpal joint. The carpal bones, together with the\\nflexor retinaculum, also form the carpal tunnel of the\\nwrist.\\nThe five metacarpal bones form the palm of the hand.\\nThe metacarpal bones are numbered 1–5, starting with\\nthe thumb side. The first metacarpal bone is freely\\nmobile, but the other bones are united as a group. The\\ndigits are also numbered 1–5, with the thumb being\\nnumber 1. The fingers and thumb contain a total of 14\\nphalanges (phalanx bones). The thumb contains a\\nproximal and a distal phalanx, whereas the remaining\\ndigits each contain proximal, middle, and distal\\nphalanges.\\n8.3 The Pelvic Girdle and Pelvis\\nThe pelvic girdle, consisting of a hip bone, serves to\\nattach a lower limb to the axial skeleton. The hip bone\\narticulates posteriorly at the sacroiliac joint with the\\nsacrum, which is part of the axial skeleton. The right\\nand left hip bones converge anteriorly and articulate\\nwith each other at the pubic symphysis. The\\ncombination of the hip bone, the sacrum, and the\\ncoccyx forms the pelvis. The pelvis has a pronounced\\nanterior tilt. The primary function of the pelvis is to\\nsupport the upper body and transfer body weight to the\\nlower limbs. It also serves as the site of attachment for\\nmultiple muscles.\\nThe hip bone consists of three regions: the ilium,\\nischium, and pubis. The ilium forms the large, fan-like\\nregion of the hip bone. The superior margin of this area\\nis the iliac crest. Located at either end of the iliac crest\\nare the anterior superior and posterior superior iliac\\nspines. Inferior to these are the anterior inferior and\\nposterior inferior iliac spines. The auricular surface of\\nthe ilium articulates with the sacrum to form the\\nsacroiliac joint. The medial surface of the upper ilium\\nforms the iliac fossa, with the arcuate line marking the\\ninferior limit of this area. The posterior margin of the\\nilium has the large greater sciatic notch.\\nThe posterolateral portion of the hip bone is the\\nischium. It has the expanded ischial tuberosity, which\\nsupports body weight when sitting. The ischial ramus\\nprojects anteriorly and superiorly. The posterior margin\\nof the ischium has the shallow lesser sciatic notch and\\nthe ischial spine, which separates the greater and\\nlesser sciatic notches.\\nThe pubis forms the anterior portion of the hip bone.\\nThe body of the pubis articulates with the pubis of the\\nopposite hip bone at the pubic symphysis. The superior\\nmargin of the pubic body has the pubic tubercle. The\\npubis is joined to the ilium by the superior pubic ramus,\\nthe superior surface of which forms the pectineal line.\\nThe inferior pubic ramus projects inferiorly and\\nlaterally. The pubic arch is formed by the pubic\\nsymphysis, the bodies of the adjacent pubic bones, and\\nthe two inferior pubic rami. The inferior pubic ramus\\njoins the ischial ramus to form the ischiopubic ramus.\\nThe subpubic angle is formed by the medial\\nconvergence of the right and left ischiopubic rami.\\nThe lateral side of the hip bone has the cup-like\\nacetabulum, which is part of the hip joint. The large\\nanterior opening is the obturator foramen. The\\nsacroiliac joint is supported by the anterior and\\nposterior sacroiliac ligaments. The sacrum is also\\njoined to the hip bone by the sacrospinous ligament,\\nwhich attaches to the ischial spine, and the\\nsacrotuberous ligament, which attaches to the ischial\\ntuberosity. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous\\nligaments contribute to the formation of the greater\\nand lesser sciatic foramina.\\nThe broad space of the upper pelvis is the greater\\npelvis, and the narrow, inferior space is the lesser\\npelvis. These areas are separated by the pelvic brim\\n(pelvic inlet). The inferior opening of the pelvis is the\\npelvic outlet. Compared to the male, the female pelvis\\nis wider to accommodate childbirth, has a larger\\nsubpubic angle, and a broader greater sciatic notch.\\n8 • Chapter Review 307'),\n",

These are\\nthe thigh, located between the hip and knee joints; the\\nleg, located between the knee and ankle joints; and\\ndistal to the ankle, the foot. There are 30 bones in each\\nlower limb. These are the femur, patella, tibia, fibula,\\nseven tarsal bones, five metatarsal bones, and 14\\nphalanges.\\nThe femur is the single bone of the thigh. Its rounded\\nhead articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone to\\nform the hip joint. The head has the fovea capitis for\\nattachment of the ligament of the head of the femur.\\nThe narrow neck joins inferiorly with the greater and\\nlesser trochanters. Passing between these bony\\nexpansions are the intertrochanteric line on the\\nanterior femur and the larger intertrochanteric crest on\\nthe posterior femur. On the posterior shaft of the femur\\nis the gluteal tuberosity proximally and the linea aspera\\nin the mid-shaft region. The expanded distal end\\nconsists of three articulating surfaces: the medial and\\nlateral condyles, and the patellar surface. The outside\\nmargins of the condyles are the medial and lateral\\nepicondyles. The adductor tubercle is on the superior\\naspect of the medial epicondyle.\\nThe patella is a sesamoid bone located within a muscle\\ntendon. It articulates with the patellar surface on the\\nanterior side of the distal femur, thereby protecting the\\nmuscle tendon from rubbing against the femur.\\nThe leg contains the large tibia on the medial side and\\nthe slender fibula on the lateral side. The tibia bears\\nthe weight of the body, whereas the fibula does not\\nbear weight. The interosseous border of each bone is\\nthe attachment site for the interosseous membrane of\\nthe leg, the connective tissue sheet that unites the tibia\\nand fibula.\\nThe proximal tibia consists of the expanded medial and\\nlateral condyles, which articulate with the medial and\\nlateral condyles of the femur to form the knee joint.\\nBetween the tibial condyles is the intercondylar\\neminence. On the anterior side of the proximal tibia is\\nthe tibial tuberosity, which is continuous inferiorly with\\nthe anterior border of the tibia. On the posterior side,\\nthe proximal tibia has the curved soleal line. The bony\\nexpansion on the medial side of the distal tibia is the\\nmedial malleolus. The groove on the lateral side of the\\ndistal tibia is the fibular notch.\\nThe head of the fibula forms the proximal end and\\narticulates with the underside of the lateral condyle of\\nthe tibia. The distal fibula articulates with the fibular\\nnotch of the tibia. The expanded distal end of the fibula\\nis the lateral malleolus.\\nThe posterior foot is formed by the seven tarsal bones.\\nThe talus articulates superiorly with the distal tibia, the\\nmedial malleolus of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus\\nof the fibula to form the ankle joint. The talus\\narticulates inferiorly with the calcaneus bone. The\\nsustentaculum tali of the calcaneus helps to support\\nthe talus. Anterior to the talus is the navicular bone,\\nand anterior to this are the medial, intermediate, and\\nlateral cuneiform bones. The cuboid bone is anterior to\\nthe calcaneus.\\nThe five metatarsal bones form the anterior foot. The\\nbase of these bones articulate with the cuboid or\\ncuneiform bones. The metatarsal heads, at their distal\\nends, articulate with the proximal phalanges of the\\ntoes. The big toe (toe number 1) has proximal and\\ndistal phalanx bones. The remaining toes have\\nproximal, middle, and distal phalanges.\\n8.5 Development of the Appendicular\\nSkeleton\\nThe bones of the appendicular skeleton arise from\\nembryonic mesenchyme. Limb buds appear at the end\\nof the fourth week. The apical ectodermal ridge,\\nlocated at the end of the limb bud, stimulates growth\\nand elongation of the limb. During the sixth week, the\\ndistal end of the limb bud becomes paddle-shaped,\\nand selective cell death separates the developing\\nfingers and toes. At the same time, mesenchyme within\\nthe limb bud begins to differentiate into hyaline\\ncartilage, forming models for future bones. During the\\nseventh week, the upper limbs rotate laterally and the\\nlower limbs rotate medially, bringing the limbs into\\ntheir final positions.\\nEndochondral ossification, the process that converts\\nthe hyaline cartilage model into bone, begins in most\\nappendicular bones by the twelfth fetal week. This\\nbegins as a primary ossification center in the diaphysis,\\nfollowed by the later appearance of one or more\\nsecondary ossifications centers in the regions of the\\nepiphyses. Each secondary ossification center is\\nseparated from the primary ossification center by an\\nepiphyseal plate. Continued growth of the epiphyseal\\nplate cartilage provides for bone lengthening.\\nDisappearance of the epiphyseal plate is followed by\\nfusion of the bony components to form a single, adult\\nbone.\\nThe clavicle develops via intramembranous\\nossification, in which mesenchyme is converted\\ndirectly into bone tissue. Ossification within the clavicle\\nbegins during the fifth week of development and\\n308 8 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Joints are the location where bones come together. Many joints allow\\nfor movement between the bones. At these joints, the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones can move\\nsmoothly against each other. However, the bones of other joints may be joined to each other by connective tissue or\\ncartilage. These joints are designed for stability and provide for little or no movement. Importantly, joint stability and\\nmovement are related to each other. This means that stable joints allow for little or no mobility between the\\nadjacent bones. Conversely, joints that provide the most movement between bones are the least stable.\\nUnderstanding the relationship between joint structure and function will help to explain why particular types of\\njoints are found in certain areas of the body.\\nThe articulating surfaces of bones at stable types of joints, with little or no mobility, are strongly united to each\\nother. For example, most of the joints of the skull are held together by fibrous connective tissue and do not allow for\\nmovement between the adjacent bones. This lack of mobility is important, because the skull bones serve to protect\\nthe brain. Similarly, other joints united by fibrous connective tissue allow for very little movement, which provides\\nstability and weight-bearing support for the body. For example, the tibia and fibula of the leg are tightly united to\\ngive stability to the body when standing. At other joints, the bones are held together by cartilage, which permits\\nlimited movements between the bones. Thus, the joints of the vertebral column only allow for small movements\\nbetween adjacent vertebrae, but when added together, these movements provide the flexibility that allows your\\nbody to twist, or bend to the front, back, or side. In contrast, at joints that allow for wide ranges of motion, the\\narticulating surfaces of the bones are not directly united to each other. Instead, these surfaces are enclosed within a\\nFigure 9.1 Kayaking Without joints, body movements would be impossible. (credit: Graham Richardson/flickr.com)'),\n",

These joints provide\\ngreater mobility, but since the bones are free to move in relation to each other, the joint is less stable. Most of the\\njoints between the bones of the appendicular skeleton are this freely moveable type of joint. These joints allow the\\nmuscles of the body to pull on a bone and thereby produce movement of that body region. Your ability to kick a\\nsoccer ball, pick up a fork, and dance the tango depend on mobility at these types of joints.\\n9.1 Classification of Joints\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Distinguish between the functional and structural classifications for joints\\n• Describe the three functional types of joints and give an example of each\\n• List the three types of diarthrodial joints\\nA joint, also called an articulation, is any place where adjacent bones or bone and cartilage come together\\n(articulate with each other) to form a connection. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally. Structural\\nclassifications of joints take into account whether the adjacent bones are strongly anchored to each other by fibrous\\nconnective tissue or cartilage, or whether the adjacent bones articulate with each other within a fluid-filled space\\ncalled a joint cavity. Functional classifications describe the degree of movement available between the bones,\\nranging from immobile, to slightly mobile, to freely moveable joints. The amount of movement available at a\\nparticular joint of the body is related to the functional requirements for that joint. Thus immobile or slightly\\nmoveable joints serve to protect internal organs, give stability to the body, and allow for limited body movement. In\\ncontrast, freely moveable joints allow for much more extensive movements of the body and limbs.\\nStructural Classification of Joints\\nThe structural classification of joints is based on whether the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones are directly\\nconnected by fibrous connective tissue or cartilage, or whether the articulating surfaces contact each other within a\\nfluid-filled joint cavity. These differences serve to divide the joints of the body into three structural classifications. A\\nfibrous joint is where the adjacent bones are united by fibrous connective tissue. At a cartilaginous joint, the bones\\nare joined by hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage. At a synovial joint, the articulating surfaces of the bones are not\\ndirectly connected, but instead come into contact with each other within a joint cavity that is filled with a lubricating\\nfluid. Synovial joints allow for free movement between the bones and are the most common joints of the body.\\nFunctional Classification of Joints\\nThe functional classification of joints is determined by the amount of mobility found between the adjacent bones.\\nJoints are thus functionally classified as a synarthrosis or immobile joint, an amphiarthrosis or slightly moveable\\njoint, or as a diarthrosis, which is a freely moveable joint (arthroun = “to fasten by a joint”). Depending on their\\nlocation, fibrous joints may be functionally classified as a synarthrosis (immobile joint) or an amphiarthrosis (slightly\\nmobile joint). Cartilaginous joints are also functionally classified as either a synarthrosis or an amphiarthrosis joint.\\nAll synovial joints are functionally classified as a diarthrosis joint.\\nSynarthrosis\\nAn immobile or nearly immobile joint is called a synarthrosis. The immobile nature of these joints provide for a\\nstrong union between the articulating bones. This is important at locations where the bones provide protection for\\ninternal organs. Examples include sutures, the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull that surround and\\nprotect the brain (Figure 9.2), and the manubriosternal joint, the cartilaginous joint that unites the manubrium and\\nbody of the sternum for protection of the heart.\\n314 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

An example of this type of joint is the cartilaginous joint that\\nunites the bodies of adjacent vertebrae. Filling the gap between the vertebrae is a thick pad of fibrocartilage called\\nan intervertebral disc (Figure 9.3). Each intervertebral disc strongly unites the vertebrae but still allows for a limited\\namount of movement between them. However, the small movements available between adjacent vertebrae can sum\\ntogether along the length of the vertebral column to provide for large ranges of body movements.\\nAnother example of an amphiarthrosis is the pubic symphysis of the pelvis. This is a cartilaginous joint in which the\\npubic regions of the right and left hip bones are strongly anchored to each other by fibrocartilage. This joint normally\\nhas very little mobility. The strength of the pubic symphysis is important in conferring weight-bearing stability to the\\npelvis.\\nFIGURE 9.3 Intervertebral Disc An intervertebral disc unites the bodies of adjacent vertebrae within the vertebral column. Each disc\\nallows for limited movement between the vertebrae and thus functionally forms an amphiarthrosis type of joint. Intervertebral discs are\\nmade of fibrocartilage and thereby structurally form a symphysis type of cartilaginous joint.\\nDiarthrosis\\nA freely mobile joint is classified as a diarthrosis. These types of joints include all synovial joints of the body, which\\nprovide the majority of body movements. Most diarthrotic joints are found in the appendicular skeleton and thus\\ngive the limbs a wide range of motion. These joints are divided into three categories, based on the number of axes of\\nmotion provided by each. An axis in anatomy is described as the movements in reference to the three anatomical\\nplanes: transverse, frontal, and sagittal. Thus, diarthroses are classified as uniaxial (for movement in one plane),\\n9.1 • Classification of Joints 315'),\n",

The elbow joint, which only allows\\nfor bending or straightening, is an example of a uniaxial joint. A biaxial joint allows for motions within two planes.\\nAn example of a biaxial joint is a metacarpophalangeal joint (knuckle joint) of the hand. The joint allows for\\nmovement along one axis to produce bending or straightening of the finger, and movement along a second axis,\\nwhich allows for spreading of the fingers away from each other and bringing them together. A joint that allows for\\nthe several directions of movement is called a multiaxial joint (polyaxial or triaxial joint). This type of diarthrotic\\njoint allows for movement along three axes (Figure 9.4). The shoulder and hip joints are multiaxial joints. They allow\\nthe upper or lower limb to move in an anterior-posterior direction and a medial-lateral direction. In addition, the\\nlimb can also be rotated around its long axis. This third movement results in rotation of the limb so that its anterior\\nsurface is moved either toward or away from the midline of the body.\\nFIGURE 9.4 Multiaxial Joint A multiaxial joint, such as the hip joint, allows for three types of movement: anterior-posterior, medial-\\nlateral, and rotational.\\n9.2 Fibrous Joints\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the structural features of fibrous joints\\n• Distinguish between a suture, syndesmosis, and gomphosis\\n• Give an example of each type of fibrous joint\\nAt a fibrous joint, the adjacent bones are directly connected to each other by fibrous connective tissue, and thus the\\nbones do not have a joint cavity between them (Figure 9.5). The gap between the bones may be narrow or wide.\\nThere are three types of fibrous joints. A suture is the narrow fibrous joint found between most bones of the skull. At\\na syndesmosis joint, the bones are more widely separated but are held together by a narrow band of fibrous\\nconnective tissue called a ligament or a wide sheet of connective tissue called an interosseous membrane. This\\ntype of fibrous joint is found between the shaft regions of the long bones in the forearm and in the leg. Lastly, a\\ngomphosis is the narrow fibrous joint between the roots of a tooth and the bony socket in the jaw into which the\\ntooth fits.\\n316 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

(a) Sutures join most bones of the skull. (b) An\\ninterosseous membrane forms a syndesmosis between the radius and ulna bones of the forearm. (c) A gomphosis is a specialized fibrous\\njoint that anchors a tooth to its socket in the jaw.\\nSuture\\nAll the bones of the skull, except for the mandible, are joined to each other by a fibrous joint called a suture. The\\nfibrous connective tissue found at a suture (“to bind or sew”) strongly unites the adjacent skull bones and thus\\nhelps to protect the brain and form the face. In adults, the skull bones are closely opposed and fibrous connective\\ntissue fills the narrow gap between the bones. The suture is frequently convoluted, forming a tight union that\\nprevents most movement between the bones. (See Figure 9.5a.) Thus, skull sutures are functionally classified as a\\nsynarthrosis, although some sutures may allow for slight movements between the cranial bones.\\nIn newborns and infants, the areas of connective tissue between the bones are much wider, especially in those\\nareas on the top and sides of the skull that will become the sagittal, coronal, squamous, and lambdoid sutures.\\nThese broad areas of connective tissue are called fontanelles (Figure 9.6). During birth, the fontanelles provide\\nflexibility to the skull, allowing the bones to push closer together or to overlap slightly, thus aiding movement of the\\ninfant’s head through the birth canal. After birth, these expanded regions of connective tissue allow for rapid growth\\nof the skull and enlargement of the brain. The fontanelles greatly decrease in width during the first year after birth as\\nthe skull bones enlarge. When the connective tissue between the adjacent bones is reduced to a narrow layer, these\\nfibrous joints are now called sutures. At some sutures, the connective tissue will ossify and be converted into bone,\\ncausing the adjacent bones to fuse to each other. This fusion between bones is called a synostosis (“joined by\\nbone”). Examples of synostosis fusions between cranial bones are found both early and late in life. At the time of\\nbirth, the frontal and maxillary bones consist of right and left halves joined together by sutures, which disappear by\\nthe eighth year as the halves fuse together to form a single bone. Late in life, the sagittal, coronal, and lambdoid\\nsutures of the skull will begin to ossify and fuse, causing the suture line to gradually disappear.\\n9.2 • Fibrous Joints 317'),\n",

The gap between the bones may be narrow, with the bones joined by ligaments,\\nor the gap may be wide and filled in by a broad sheet of connective tissue called an interosseous membrane.\\nIn the forearm, the wide gap between the shaft portions of the radius and ulna bones are strongly united by an\\ninterosseous membrane (see Figure 9.5b). Similarly, in the leg, the shafts of the tibia and fibula are also united by an\\ninterosseous membrane. In addition, at the distal tibiofibular joint, the articulating surfaces of the bones lack\\ncartilage and the narrow gap between the bones is anchored by fibrous connective tissue and ligaments on both the\\nanterior and posterior aspects of the joint. Together, the interosseous membrane and these ligaments form the\\ntibiofibular syndesmosis.\\nThe syndesmoses found in the forearm and leg serve to unite parallel bones and prevent their separation. However,\\na syndesmosis does not prevent all movement between the bones, and thus this type of fibrous joint is functionally\\nclassified as an amphiarthrosis. In the leg, the syndesmosis between the tibia and fibula strongly unites the bones,\\nallows for little movement, and firmly locks the talus bone in place between the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint.\\nThis provides strength and stability to the leg and ankle, which are important during weight bearing. In the forearm,\\nthe interosseous membrane is flexible enough to allow for rotation of the radius bone during forearm movements.\\nThus in contrast to the stability provided by the tibiofibular syndesmosis, the flexibility of the antebrachial\\ninterosseous membrane allows for the much greater mobility of the forearm.\\nThe interosseous membranes of the leg and forearm also provide areas for muscle attachment. Damage to a\\nsyndesmotic joint, which usually results from a fracture of the bone with an accompanying tear of the interosseous\\nmembrane, will produce pain, loss of stability of the bones, and may damage the muscles attached to the\\ninterosseous membrane. If the fracture site is not properly immobilized with a cast or splint, contractile activity by\\nthese muscles can cause improper alignment of the broken bones during healing.\\nGomphosis\\nA gomphosis (“fastened with bolts”) is the specialized fibrous joint that anchors the root of a tooth into its bony\\nsocket within the maxillary bone (upper jaw) or mandible bone (lower jaw) of the skull. A gomphosis is also known\\nas a peg-and-socket joint. Spanning between the bony walls of the socket and the root of the tooth are numerous\\nshort bands of dense connective tissue, each of which is called a periodontal ligament (see Figure 9.5c). Due to the\\nimmobility of a gomphosis, this type of joint is functionally classified as a synarthrosis.\\n318 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These types of joints lack a joint cavity and involve bones that are joined together by either\\nhyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage (Figure 9.7). There are two types of cartilaginous joints. A synchondrosis is a\\ncartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Also classified as a synchondrosis are places\\nwhere bone is united to a cartilage structure, such as between the anterior end of a rib and the costal cartilage of the\\nthoracic cage. The second type of cartilaginous joint is a symphysis, where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage.\\nFIGURE 9.7 Cartilaginous Joints At cartilaginous joints, bones are united by hyaline cartilage to form a synchondrosis or by\\nfibrocartilage to form a symphysis. (a) The hyaline cartilage of the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) forms a synchondrosis that unites the\\nshaft (diaphysis) and end (epiphysis) of a long bone and allows the bone to grow in length. (b) The pubic portions of the right and left hip\\nbones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage, forming the pubic symphysis.\\nSynchondrosis\\nA synchondrosis (“joined by cartilage”) is a cartilaginous joint where bones are joined together by hyaline cartilage,\\nor where bone is united to hyaline cartilage. A synchondrosis may be temporary or permanent. A temporary\\nsynchondrosis is the epiphyseal plate (growth plate) of a growing long bone. The epiphyseal plate is the region of\\ngrowing hyaline cartilage that unites the diaphysis (shaft) of the bone to the epiphysis (end of the bone). Bone\\nlengthening involves growth of the epiphyseal plate cartilage and its replacement by bone, which adds to the\\ndiaphysis. For many years during childhood growth, the rates of cartilage growth and bone formation are equal and\\nthus the epiphyseal plate does not change in overall thickness as the bone lengthens. During the late teens and\\nearly 20s, growth of the cartilage slows and eventually stops. The epiphyseal plate is then completely replaced by\\nbone, and the diaphysis and epiphysis portions of the bone fuse together to form a single adult bone. This fusion of\\nthe diaphysis and epiphysis is a synostosis. Once this occurs, bone lengthening ceases. For this reason, the\\nepiphyseal plate is considered to be a temporary synchondrosis. Because cartilage is softer than bone tissue, injury\\nto a growing long bone can damage the epiphyseal plate cartilage, thus stopping bone growth and preventing\\nadditional bone lengthening.\\nGrowing layers of cartilage also form synchondroses that join together the ilium, ischium, and pubic portions of the\\nhip bone during childhood and adolescence. When body growth stops, the cartilage disappears and is replaced by\\nbone, forming synostoses and fusing the bony components together into the single hip bone of the adult. Similarly,\\nsynostoses unite the sacral vertebrae that fuse together to form the adult sacrum.\\n9.3 • Cartilaginous Joints 319'),\n",

Being less dense than bone, the area of epiphyseal cartilage is seen on this radiograph as the dark epiphyseal\\ngaps located near the ends of the long bones, including the radius, ulna, metacarpal, and phalanx bones. Which of\\nthe bones in this image do not show an epiphyseal plate (epiphyseal gap)?\\nExamples of permanent synchondroses are found in the thoracic cage. One example is the first sternocostal joint,\\nwhere the first rib is anchored to the manubrium by its costal cartilage. (The articulations of the remaining costal\\ncartilages to the sternum are all synovial joints.) Additional synchondroses are formed where the anterior end of the\\nother 11 ribs is joined to its costal cartilage. Unlike the temporary synchondroses of the epiphyseal plate, these\\npermanent synchondroses retain their hyaline cartilage and thus do not ossify with age. Due to the lack of\\nmovement between the bone and cartilage, both temporary and permanent synchondroses are functionally\\nclassified as a synarthrosis.\\nSymphysis\\nA cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis (“growing together”).\\nFibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much\\ngreater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the\\nability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is\\nfunctionally classified as an amphiarthrosis.\\nThe gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones\\nis narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of\\nthe right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the\\nmanubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum.\\nThe intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral\\ncolumn. Here a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the adjacent vertebrae by\\nfilling the gap between them. The width of the intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small\\nmovements between the adjacent vertebrae. In addition, the thick intervertebral disc provides cushioning between\\nthe vertebrae, which is important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities such as running or\\njumping.\\n9.4 Synovial Joints\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the structural features of a synovial joint\\n• Discuss the function of additional structures associated with synovial joints\\n• List the six types of synovial joints and give an example of each\\nSynovial joints are the most common type of joint in the body (Figure 9.8). A key structural characteristic for a\\nsynovial joint that is not seen at fibrous or cartilaginous joints is the presence of a joint cavity. This fluid-filled space\\nis the site at which the articulating surfaces of the bones contact each other. Also unlike fibrous or cartilaginous\\njoints, the articulating bone surfaces at a synovial joint are not directly connected to each other with fibrous\\nconnective tissue or cartilage. This gives the bones of a synovial joint the ability to move smoothly against each\\nother, allowing for increased joint mobility.\\n320 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The joint is surrounded by an\\narticular capsule that defines a joint cavity filled with synovial fluid. The articulating surfaces of the bones are covered by a thin layer of\\narticular cartilage. Ligaments support the joint by holding the bones together and resisting excess or abnormal joint motions.\\nStructural Features of Synovial Joints\\nSynovial joints are characterized by the presence of a joint cavity. The walls of this space are formed by the articular\\ncapsule, a fibrous connective tissue structure that is attached to each bone just outside the area of the bone’s\\narticulating surface. The bones of the joint articulate with each other within the joint cavity.\\nFriction between the bones at a synovial joint is prevented by the presence of the articular cartilage, a thin layer of\\nhyaline cartilage that covers the entire articulating surface of each bone. However, unlike at a cartilaginous joint, the\\narticular cartilages of each bone are not continuous with each other. Instead, the articular cartilage acts like a\\nTeflon® coating over the bone surface, allowing the articulating bones to move smoothly against each other without\\ndamaging the underlying bone tissue. Lining the inner surface of the articular capsule is a thin synovial membrane.\\nThe cells of this membrane secrete synovial fluid (synovia = “a thick fluid”), a thick, slimy fluid that provides\\nlubrication to further reduce friction between the bones of the joint. This fluid also provides nourishment to the\\narticular cartilage, which does not contain blood vessels. The ability of the bones to move smoothly against each\\nother within the joint cavity, and the freedom of joint movement this provides, means that each synovial joint is\\nfunctionally classified as a diarthrosis.\\nOutside of their articulating surfaces, the bones are connected together by ligaments, which are strong bands of\\nfibrous connective tissue. These strengthen and support the joint by anchoring the bones together and preventing\\ntheir separation. Ligaments allow for normal movements at a joint, but limit the range of these motions, thus\\npreventing excessive or abnormal joint movements. Ligaments are classified based on their relationship to the\\nfibrous articular capsule. An extrinsic ligament is located outside of the articular capsule, an intrinsic ligament is\\nfused to or incorporated into the wall of the articular capsule, and an intracapsular ligament is located inside of the\\narticular capsule.\\nAt many synovial joints, additional support is provided by the muscles and their tendons that act across the joint. A\\ntendon is the dense connective tissue structure that attaches a muscle to bone. As forces acting on a joint increase,\\n9.4 • Synovial Joints 321'),\n",

This type\\nof indirect support by muscles is very important at the shoulder joint, for example, where the ligaments are\\nrelatively weak.\\nAdditional Structures Associated with Synovial Joints\\nA few synovial joints of the body have a fibrocartilage structure located between the articulating bones. This is\\ncalled an articular disc, which is generally small and oval-shaped, or a meniscus, which is larger and C-shaped.\\nThese structures can serve several functions, depending on the specific joint. In some places, an articular disc may\\nact to strongly unite the bones of the joint to each other. Examples of this include the articular discs found at the\\nsternoclavicular joint or between the distal ends of the radius and ulna bones. At other synovial joints, the disc can\\nprovide shock absorption and cushioning between the bones, which is the function of each meniscus within the\\nknee joint. Finally, an articular disc can serve to smooth the movements between the articulating bones, as seen at\\nthe temporomandibular joint. Some synovial joints also have a fat pad, which can serve as a cushion between the\\nbones.\\nAdditional structures located outside of a synovial joint serve to prevent friction between the bones of the joint and\\nthe overlying muscle tendons or skin. A bursa (plural = bursae) is a thin connective tissue sac filled with lubricating\\nliquid. They are located in regions where skin, ligaments, muscles, or muscle tendons can rub against each other,\\nusually near a body joint (Figure 9.9). Bursae reduce friction by separating the adjacent structures, preventing them\\nfrom rubbing directly against each other. Bursae are classified by their location. A subcutaneous bursa is located\\nbetween the skin and an underlying bone. It allows skin to move smoothly over the bone. Examples include the\\nprepatellar bursa located over the kneecap and the olecranon bursa at the tip of the elbow. A submuscular bursa is\\nfound between a muscle and an underlying bone, or between adjacent muscles. These prevent rubbing of the\\nmuscle during movements. A large submuscular bursa, the trochanteric bursa, is found at the lateral hip, between\\nthe greater trochanter of the femur and the overlying gluteus maximus muscle. A subtendinous bursa is found\\nbetween a tendon and a bone. Examples include the subacromial bursa that protects the tendon of shoulder muscle\\nas it passes under the acromion of the scapula, and the suprapatellar bursa that separates the tendon of the large\\nanterior thigh muscle from the distal femur just above the knee.\\nFIGURE 9.9 Bursae Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that serve to prevent friction between skin, muscle, or tendon and an underlying bone.\\nThree major bursae and a fat pad are part of the complex joint that unites the femur and tibia of the leg.\\nA tendon sheath is similar in structure to a bursa, but smaller. It is a connective tissue sac that surrounds a muscle\\ntendon at places where the tendon crosses a joint. It contains a lubricating fluid that allows for smooth motions of\\nthe tendon during muscle contraction and joint movements.\\n322 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This will cause pain, swelling, or tenderness of the bursa and\\nsurrounding area, and may also result in joint stiffness. Bursitis is most commonly associated with the bursae found\\nat or near the shoulder, hip, knee, or elbow joints. At the shoulder, subacromial bursitis may occur in the bursa that\\nseparates the acromion of the scapula from the tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the acromion. In\\nthe hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just\\nbelow the lateral side of the hip. Ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial\\ntuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. At the knee, inflammation and\\nswelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a\\ncondition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads. At the\\nelbow, olecranon bursitis is inflammation of the bursa between the skin and olecranon process of the ulna. The\\nolecranon forms the bony tip of the elbow, and bursitis here is also known as “student’s elbow.”\\nBursitis can be either acute (lasting only a few days) or chronic. It can arise from muscle overuse, trauma, excessive\\nor prolonged pressure on the skin, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection of the joint. Repeated acute episodes of\\nbursitis can result in a chronic condition. Treatments for the disorder include antibiotics if the bursitis is caused by\\nan infection, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids\\nif the bursitis is due to trauma or overuse. Chronic bursitis may require that fluid be drained, but additional surgery is\\nusually not required.\\nTypes of Synovial Joints\\nSynovial joints are subdivided based on the shapes of the articulating surfaces of the bones that form each joint. The\\nsix types of synovial joints are pivot, hinge, condyloid, saddle, plane, and ball-and socket-joints (Figure 9.10).\\n9.4 • Synovial Joints 323'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 339}, page_content='FIGURE 9.10 Types of Synovial Joints The six types of synovial joints allow the body to move in a variety of ways. (a) Pivot joints allow\\nfor rotation around an axis, such as between the first and second cervical vertebrae, which allows for side-to-side rotation of the head. (b)\\nThe hinge joint of the elbow works like a door hinge. (c) The articulation between the trapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone\\nat the base of the thumb is a saddle joint. (d) Plane joints, such as those between the tarsal bones of the foot, allow for limited gliding\\nmovements between bones. (e) The radiocarpal joint of the wrist is a condyloid joint. (f) The hip and shoulder joints are the only ball-and-\\nsocket joints of the body.\\nPivot Joint\\nAt a pivot joint, a rounded portion of a bone is enclosed within a ring formed partially by the articulation with\\nanother bone and partially by a ligament (see Figure 9.10a). The bone rotates within this ring. Since the rotation is\\naround a single axis, pivot joints are functionally classified as a uniaxial diarthrosis type of joint. An example of a\\npivot joint is the atlantoaxial joint, found between the C1 (atlas) and C2 (axis) vertebrae. Here, the upward projecting\\ndens of the axis articulates with the inner aspect of the atlas, where it is held in place by a ligament. Rotation at this\\n324 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A second pivot joint is found at the proximal radioulnar joint.\\nHere, the head of the radius is largely encircled by a ligament that holds it in place as it articulates with the radial\\nnotch of the ulna. Rotation of the radius allows for forearm movements.\\nHinge Joint\\nIn a hinge joint, the convex end of one bone articulates with the concave end of the adjoining bone (see Figure\\n9.10b). This type of joint allows only for bending and straightening motions along a single axis, and thus hinge joints\\nare functionally classified as uniaxial joints. A good example is the elbow joint, with the articulation between the\\ntrochlea of the humerus and the trochlear notch of the ulna. Other hinge joints of the body include the knee, ankle,\\nand interphalangeal joints between the phalanx bones of the fingers and toes.\\nCondyloid Joint\\nAt a condyloid joint (ellipsoid joint), the shallow depression at the end of one bone articulates with a rounded\\nstructure from an adjacent bone or bones (see Figure 9.10e). The knuckle (metacarpophalangeal) joints of the hand\\nbetween the distal end of a metacarpal bone and the proximal phalanx bone are condyloid joints. Another example\\nis the radiocarpal joint of the wrist, between the shallow depression at the distal end of the radius bone and the\\nrounded scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum carpal bones. In this case, the articulation area has a more oval (elliptical)\\nshape. Functionally, condyloid joints are biaxial joints that allow for two planes of movement. One movement\\ninvolves the bending and straightening of the fingers or the anterior-posterior movements of the hand. The second\\nmovement is a side-to-side movement, which allows you to spread your fingers apart and bring them together, or to\\nmove your hand in a medial-going or lateral-going direction.\\nSaddle Joint\\nAt a saddle joint, both of the articulating surfaces for the bones have a saddle shape, which is concave in one\\ndirection and convex in the other (see Figure 9.10c). This allows the two bones to fit together like a rider sitting on a\\nsaddle. Saddle joints are functionally classified as biaxial joints. The primary example is the first carpometacarpal\\njoint, between the trapezium (a carpal bone) and the first metacarpal bone at the base of the thumb. This joint\\nprovides the thumb the ability to move away from the palm of the hand along two planes. Thus, the thumb can move\\nwithin the same plane as the palm of the hand, or it can jut out anteriorly, perpendicular to the palm. This movement\\nof the first carpometacarpal joint is what gives humans their distinctive “opposable” thumbs. The sternoclavicular\\njoint is also classified as a saddle joint.\\nPlane Joint\\nAt a plane joint (gliding joint), the articulating surfaces of the bones are flat or slightly curved and of approximately\\nthe same size, which allows the bones to slide against each other (see Figure 9.10d). The motion at this type of joint\\nis usually small and tightly constrained by surrounding ligaments. Based only on their shape, plane joints can allow\\nmultiple movements, including rotation. Thus plane joints can be functionally classified as a multiaxial joint.\\nHowever, not all of these movements are available to every plane joint due to limitations placed on it by ligaments or\\nneighboring bones. Thus, depending upon the specific joint of the body, a plane joint may exhibit only a single type\\nof movement or several movements. Plane joints are found between the carpal bones (intercarpal joints) of the wrist\\nor tarsal bones (intertarsal joints) of the foot, between the clavicle and acromion of the scapula (acromioclavicular\\njoint), and between the superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae (zygapophysial joints).\\nBall-and-Socket Joint\\nThe joint with the greatest range of motion is the ball-and-socket joint. At these joints, the rounded head of one\\nbone (the ball) fits into the concave articulation (the socket) of the adjacent bone (see Figure 9.10f). The hip joint\\nand the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint are the only ball-and-socket joints of the body. At the hip joint, the head of the\\nfemur articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone, and at the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus articulates\\nwith the glenoid cavity of the scapula.\\nBall-and-socket joints are classified functionally as multiaxial joints. The femur and the humerus are able to move in\\nboth anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions and they can also rotate around their long axis. The shallow\\nsocket formed by the glenoid cavity allows the shoulder joint an extensive range of motion. In contrast, the deep\\nsocket of the acetabulum and the strong supporting ligaments of the hip joint serve to constrain movements of the\\nfemur, reflecting the need for stability and weight-bearing ability at the hip.\\n9.4 • Synovial Joints 325'),\n",

The different types of synovial joints are the\\nball-and-socket joint (shoulder joint), hinge joint (knee), pivot joint (atlantoaxial joint, between C1 and C2 vertebrae\\nof the neck), condyloid joint (radiocarpal joint of the wrist), saddle joint (first carpometacarpal joint, between the\\ntrapezium carpal bone and the first metacarpal bone, at the base of the thumb), and plane joint (facet joints of\\nvertebral column, between superior and inferior articular processes). Which type of synovial joint allows for the\\nwidest range of motion?\\nAging and the...\\nJoints\\nArthritis is a common disorder of synovial joints that involves inflammation of the joint. This often results in\\nsignificant joint pain, along with swelling, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility. There are more than 100 different\\nforms of arthritis. Arthritis may arise from aging, damage to the articular cartilage, autoimmune diseases,\\nbacterial or viral infections, or unknown (probably genetic) causes.\\nThe most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is associated with aging and “wear and tear” of the\\narticular cartilage (Figure 9.11). Risk factors that may lead to osteoarthritis later in life include injury to a joint;\\njobs that involve physical labor; sports with running, twisting, or throwing actions; and being overweight. These\\nfactors put stress on the articular cartilage that covers the surfaces of bones at synovial joints, causing the\\ncartilage to gradually become thinner. As the articular cartilage layer wears down, more pressure is placed on\\nthe bones. The joint responds by increasing production of the lubricating synovial fluid, but this can lead to\\nswelling of the joint cavity, causing pain and joint stiffness as the articular capsule is stretched. The bone tissue\\nunderlying the damaged articular cartilage also responds by thickening, producing irregularities and causing the\\narticulating surface of the bone to become rough or bumpy. Joint movement then results in pain and\\ninflammation. In its early stages, symptoms of osteoarthritis may be reduced by mild activity that “warms up”\\nthe joint, but the symptoms may worsen following exercise. In individuals with more advanced osteoarthritis,\\nthe affected joints can become more painful and therefore are difficult to use effectively, resulting in increased\\nimmobility. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but several treatments can help alleviate the pain. Treatments\\nmay include lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and low-impact exercise, and over-the-counter or\\nprescription medications that help to alleviate the pain and inflammation. For severe cases, joint replacement\\nsurgery (arthroplasty) may be required.\\nJoint replacement is a very invasive procedure, so other treatments are always tried before surgery. However\\narthroplasty can provide relief from chronic pain and can enhance mobility within a few months following the\\nsurgery. This type of surgery involves replacing the articular surfaces of the bones with prosthesis (artificial\\ncomponents). For example, in hip arthroplasty, the worn or damaged parts of the hip joint, including the head\\nand neck of the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis, are removed and replaced with artificial joint\\ncomponents. The replacement head for the femur consists of a rounded ball attached to the end of a shaft that\\nis inserted inside the diaphysis of the femur. The acetabulum of the pelvis is reshaped and a replacement socket\\nis fitted into its place. The parts, which are always built in advance of the surgery, are sometimes custom made\\nto produce the best possible fit for a patient.\\nGout is a form of arthritis that results from the deposition of uric acid crystals within a body joint. Usually only\\none or a few joints are affected, such as the big toe, knee, or ankle. The attack may only last a few days, but may\\nreturn to the same or another joint. Gout occurs when the body makes too much uric acid or the kidneys do not\\nproperly excrete it. A diet with excessive fructose has been implicated in raising the chances of a susceptible\\nindividual developing gout.\\nOther forms of arthritis are associated with various autoimmune diseases, bacterial infections of the joint, or\\nunknown genetic causes. Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or systemic lupus\\nerythematosus, produce arthritis because the immune system of the body attacks the body joints.

Each movement at a synovial joint results from\\nthe contraction or relaxation of the muscles that are attached to the bones on either side of the articulation. The\\ntype of movement that can be produced at a synovial joint is determined by its structural type. While the ball-and-\\nsocket joint gives the greatest range of movement at an individual joint, in other regions of the body, several joints\\nmay work together to produce a particular movement. Overall, each type of synovial joint is necessary to provide the\\nbody with its great flexibility and mobility. There are many types of movement that can occur at synovial joints (Table\\n9.1). Movement types are generally paired, with one being the opposite of the other. Body movements are always\\nrheumatoid arthritis, the joint capsule and synovial membrane become inflamed. As the disease progresses, the\\narticular cartilage is severely damaged or destroyed, resulting in joint deformation, loss of movement, and\\nsevere disability. The most commonly involved joints are the hands, feet, and cervical spine, with corresponding\\njoints on both sides of the body usually affected, though not always to the same extent. Rheumatoid arthritis is\\nalso associated with lung fibrosis, vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels), coronary heart disease, and\\npremature mortality. With no known cure, treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms. Exercise, anti-\\ninflammatory and pain medications, various specific disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or surgery are\\nused to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\\nFIGURE 9.11 Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis of a synovial joint results from aging or prolonged joint wear and tear.

(a)–(b) Flexion and extension\\nmotions are in the sagittal (anterior–posterior) plane of motion. These movements take place at the shoulder, hip, elbow, knee, wrist,\\nmetacarpophalangeal, metatarsophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints. (c)–(d) Anterior bending of the head or vertebral column is flexion,\\nwhile any posterior-going movement is extension. (e) Abduction and adduction are motions of the limbs, hand, fingers, or toes in the\\ncoronal (medial–lateral) plane of movement. Moving the limb or hand laterally away from the body, or spreading the fingers or toes, is\\nabduction. Adduction brings the limb or hand toward or across the midline of the body, or brings the fingers or toes together. Circumduction\\nis the movement of the limb, hand, or fingers in a circular pattern, using the sequential combination of flexion, adduction, extension, and\\nabduction motions.

Flexion and extension movements are\\nseen at the hinge, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket joints of the limbs (see Figure 9.12a-d).\\nHyperextension is the abnormal or excessive extension of a joint beyond its normal range of motion, thus resulting\\nin injury. Similarly, hyperflexion is excessive flexion at a joint. Hyperextension injuries are common at hinge joints\\nsuch as the knee or elbow. In cases of “whiplash” in which the head is suddenly moved backward and then forward,\\na patient may experience both hyperextension and hyperflexion of the cervical region.\\nAbduction and Adduction\\nAbduction and adduction motions occur within the coronal plane and involve medial-lateral motions of the limbs,\\nfingers, toes, or thumb. Abduction moves the limb laterally away from the midline of the body, while adduction is the\\nopposing movement that brings the limb toward the body or across the midline. For example, abduction is raising\\nthe arm at the shoulder joint, moving it laterally away from the body, while adduction brings the arm down to the\\nside of the body. Similarly, abduction and adduction at the wrist moves the hand away from or toward the midline of\\nthe body. Spreading the fingers or toes apart is also abduction, while bringing the fingers or toes together is\\nadduction. For the thumb, abduction is the anterior movement that brings the thumb to a 90° perpendicular\\nposition, pointing straight out from the palm. Adduction moves the thumb back to the anatomical position, next to\\nthe index finger. Abduction and adduction movements are seen at condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket joints (see\\nFigure 9.12e).\\nCircumduction\\nCircumduction is the movement of a body region in a circular manner, in which one end of the body region being\\nmoved stays relatively stationary while the other end describes a circle. It involves the sequential combination of\\nflexion, adduction, extension, and abduction at a joint. This type of motion is found at biaxial condyloid and saddle\\njoints, and at multiaxial ball-and-sockets joints (see Figure 9.12e).\\nRotation\\nRotation can occur within the vertebral column, at a pivot joint, or at a ball-and-socket joint. Rotation of the neck or\\nbody is the twisting movement produced by the summation of the small rotational movements available between\\nadjacent vertebrae. At a pivot joint, one bone rotates in relation to another bone. This is a uniaxial joint, and thus\\nrotation is the only motion allowed at a pivot joint. For example, at the atlantoaxial joint, the first cervical (C1)\\nvertebra (atlas) rotates around the dens, the upward projection from the second cervical (C2) vertebra (axis). This\\nallows the head to rotate from side to side as when shaking the head “no.” The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot\\njoint formed by the head of the radius and its articulation with the ulna. This joint allows for the radius to rotate\\nalong its length during pronation and supination movements of the forearm.\\nRotation can also occur at the ball-and-socket joints of the shoulder and hip. Here, the humerus and femur rotate\\naround their long axis, which moves the anterior surface of the arm or thigh either toward or away from the midline\\nof the body. Movement that brings the anterior surface of the limb toward the midline of the body is called medial\\n(internal) rotation. Conversely, rotation of the limb so that the anterior surface moves away from the midline is\\nlateral (external) rotation (see Figure 9.12f). Be sure to distinguish medial and lateral rotation, which can only\\noccur at the multiaxial shoulder and hip joints, from circumduction, which can occur at either biaxial or multiaxial\\njoints.\\nSupination and Pronation\\nSupination and pronation are movements of the forearm. In the anatomical position, the upper limb is held next to\\nthe body with the palm facing forward. This is the supinated position of the forearm. In this position, the radius and\\nulna are parallel to each other. When the palm of the hand faces backward, the forearm is in the pronated position,\\n330 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Pronation is the\\nmotion that moves the forearm from the supinated (anatomical) position to the pronated (palm backward) position.\\nThis motion is produced by rotation of the radius at the proximal radioulnar joint, accompanied by movement of the\\nradius at the distal radioulnar joint. The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint that allows for rotation of the head of\\nthe radius. Because of the slight curvature of the shaft of the radius, this rotation causes the distal end of the radius\\nto cross over the distal ulna at the distal radioulnar joint. This crossing over brings the radius and ulna into an X-\\nshape position. Supination is the opposite motion, in which rotation of the radius returns the bones to their parallel\\npositions and moves the palm to the anterior facing (supinated) position. It helps to remember that supination is the\\nmotion you use when scooping up soup with a spoon (see Figure 9.13g).\\nDorsiflexion and Plantar Flexion\\nDorsiflexion and plantar flexion are movements at the ankle joint, which is a hinge joint. Lifting the front of the foot,\\nso that the top of the foot moves toward the anterior leg is dorsiflexion, while lifting the heel of the foot from the\\nground or pointing the toes downward is plantar flexion. These are the only movements available at the ankle joint\\n(see Figure 9.13h).\\nInversion and Eversion\\nInversion and eversion are complex movements that involve the multiple plane joints among the tarsal bones of the\\nposterior foot (intertarsal joints) and thus are not motions that take place at the ankle joint. Inversion is the turning\\nof the foot to angle the bottom of the foot toward the midline, while eversion turns the bottom of the foot away from\\nthe midline. The foot has a greater range of inversion than eversion motion. These are important motions that help\\nto stabilize the foot when walking or running on an uneven surface and aid in the quick side-to-side changes in\\ndirection used during active sports such as basketball, racquetball, or soccer (see Figure 9.13i).\\nProtraction and Retraction\\nProtraction and retraction are anterior-posterior movements of the scapula or mandible. Protraction of the scapula\\noccurs when the shoulder is moved forward, as when pushing against something or throwing a ball. Retraction is the\\nopposite motion, with the scapula being pulled posteriorly and medially, toward the vertebral column. For the\\nmandible, protraction occurs when the lower jaw is pushed forward, to stick out the chin, while retraction pulls the\\nlower jaw backward. (See Figure 9.13j.)\\nDepression and Elevation\\nDepression and elevation are downward and upward movements of the scapula or mandible. The upward\\nmovement of the scapula and shoulder is elevation, while a downward movement is depression. These movements\\nare used to shrug your shoulders. Similarly, elevation of the mandible is the upward movement of the lower jaw used\\nto close the mouth or bite on something, and depression is the downward movement that produces opening of the\\nmouth (see Figure 9.13k).\\nExcursion\\nExcursion is the side to side movement of the mandible. Lateral excursion moves the mandible away from the\\nmidline, toward either the right or left side. Medial excursion returns the mandible to its resting position at the\\nmidline.\\nSuperior Rotation and Inferior Rotation\\nSuperior and inferior rotation are movements of the scapula and are defined by the direction of movement of the\\nglenoid cavity. These motions involve rotation of the scapula around a point inferior to the scapular spine and are\\nproduced by combinations of muscles acting on the scapula. During superior rotation, the glenoid cavity moves\\nupward as the medial end of the scapular spine moves downward. This is a very important motion that contributes\\nto upper limb abduction. Without superior rotation of the scapula, the greater tubercle of the humerus would hit the\\nacromion of the scapula, thus preventing any abduction of the arm above shoulder height. Superior rotation of the\\nscapula is thus required for full abduction of the upper limb. Superior rotation is also used without arm abduction\\n9.5 • Types of Body Movements 331'),\n",

You can feel this rotation when you pick up a load,\\nsuch as a heavy book bag and carry it on only one shoulder. To increase its weight-bearing support for the bag, the\\nshoulder lifts as the scapula superiorly rotates. Inferior rotation occurs during limb adduction and involves the\\ndownward motion of the glenoid cavity with upward movement of the medial end of the scapular spine.\\nOpposition and Reposition\\nOpposition is the thumb movement that brings the tip of the thumb in contact with the tip of a finger. This\\nmovement is produced at the first carpometacarpal joint, which is a saddle joint formed between the trapezium\\ncarpal bone and the first metacarpal bone. Thumb opposition is produced by a combination of flexion and abduction\\nof the thumb at this joint. Returning the thumb to its anatomical position next to the index finger is called reposition\\n(see Figure 9.13l).\\nMovements of the Joints\\nType of\\nJoint Movement Example\\nPivot Uniaxial joint; allows rotational movement Atlantoaxial joint (C1–C2 vertebrae\\narticulation); proximal radioulnar joint\\nHinge Uniaxial joint; allows flexion/extension\\nmovements\\nKnee; elbow; ankle; interphalangeal joints of\\nfingers and toes\\nCondyloid Biaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/\\nadduction, and circumduction movements\\nMetacarpophalangeal (knuckle) joints of\\nfingers; radiocarpal joint of wrist;\\nmetatarsophalangeal joints for toes\\nSaddle Biaxial joint; allows flexion/extension, abduction/\\nadduction, and circumduction movements\\nFirst carpometacarpal joint of the thumb;\\nsternoclavicular joint\\nPlane\\nMultiaxial joint; allows inversion and eversion of\\nfoot, or flexion, extension, and lateral flexion of\\nthe vertebral column\\nIntertarsal joints of foot; superior-inferior\\narticular process articulations between\\nvertebrae\\nBall-and-\\nsocket\\nMultiaxial joint; allows flexion/extension,\\nabduction/adduction, circumduction, and medial/\\nlateral rotation movements\\nShoulder and hip joints\\nTABLE 9.1\\n9.6 Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the bones that articulate together to form selected synovial joints\\n• Discuss the movements available at each joint\\n• Describe the structures that support and prevent excess movements at each joint\\nEach synovial joint of the body is specialized to perform certain movements.

However, the ligaments and muscles that support a joint may place\\nrestrictions on the total range of motion available. Thus, the ball-and-socket joint of the shoulder has little in the\\nway of ligament support, which gives the shoulder a very large range of motion.

Anatomical names for most joints are\\nderived from the names of the bones that articulate at that joint, although some joints, such as the elbow, hip, and\\nknee joints are exceptions to this general naming scheme.\\nArticulations of the Vertebral Column\\nIn addition to being held together by the intervertebral discs, adjacent vertebrae also articulate with each other at\\nsynovial joints formed between the superior and inferior articular processes called zygapophysial joints (facet\\njoints) (see Figure 9.3). These are plane joints that provide for only limited motions between the vertebrae. The\\norientation of the articular processes at these joints varies in different regions of the vertebral column and serves to\\ndetermine the types of motions available in each vertebral region. The cervical and lumbar regions have the greatest\\nranges of motions.\\nIn the neck, the articular processes of cervical vertebrae are flattened and generally face upward or downward. This\\norientation provides the cervical vertebral column with extensive ranges of motion for flexion, extension, lateral\\nflexion, and rotation. In the thoracic region, the downward projecting and overlapping spinous processes, along with\\nthe attached thoracic cage, greatly limit flexion, extension, and lateral flexion. However, the flattened and vertically\\npositioned thoracic articular processes allow for the greatest range of rotation within the vertebral column. The\\nlumbar region allows for considerable extension, flexion, and lateral flexion, but the orientation of the articular\\nprocesses largely prohibits rotation.\\nThe articulations formed between the skull, the atlas (C1 vertebra), and the axis (C2 vertebra) differ from the\\narticulations in other vertebral areas and play important roles in movement of the head. The atlanto-occipital joint\\nis formed by the articulations between the superior articular processes of the atlas and the occipital condyles on the\\nbase of the skull. This articulation has a pronounced U-shaped curvature, oriented along the anterior-posterior axis.\\nThis allows the skull to rock forward and backward, producing flexion and extension of the head. This moves the\\nhead up and down, as when shaking your head “yes.”\\nThe atlantoaxial joint, between the atlas and axis, consists of three articulations. The paired superior articular\\nprocesses of the axis articulate with the inferior articular processes of the atlas. These articulating surfaces are\\nrelatively flat and oriented horizontally. The third articulation is the pivot joint formed between the dens, which\\nprojects upward from the body of the axis, and the inner aspect of the anterior arch of the atlas (Figure 9.14). A\\nstrong ligament passes posterior to the dens to hold it in position against the anterior arch. These articulations allow\\nthe atlas to rotate on top of the axis, moving the head toward the right or left, as when shaking your head “no.”\\nFIGURE 9.14 Atlantoaxial Joint The atlantoaxial joint is a pivot type of joint between the dens portion of the axis (C2 vertebra) and the\\nanterior arch of the atlas (C1 vertebra), with the dens held in place by a ligament.\\nTemporomandibular Joint\\nThe temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that allows for opening (mandibular depression) and closing\\n(mandibular elevation) of the mouth, as well as side-to-side and protraction/retraction motions of the lower jaw.\\n9.6 • Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints 333'),\n",

This disc serves to smooth the movements between the temporal\\nbone and mandibular condyle.\\nMovement at the TMJ during opening and closing of the mouth involves both gliding and hinge motions of the\\nmandible. With the mouth closed, the mandibular condyle and articular disc are located within the mandibular fossa\\nof the temporal bone. During opening of the mouth, the mandible hinges downward and at the same time is pulled\\nanteriorly, causing both the condyle and the articular disc to glide forward from the mandibular fossa onto the\\ndownward projecting articular tubercle. The net result is a forward and downward motion of the condyle and\\nmandibular depression. The temporomandibular joint is supported by an extrinsic ligament that anchors the\\nmandible to the skull. This ligament spans the distance between the base of the skull and the lingula on the medial\\nside of the mandibular ramus.\\nDislocation of the TMJ may occur when opening the mouth too wide (such as when taking a large bite) or following a\\nblow to the jaw, resulting in the mandibular condyle moving beyond (anterior to) the articular tubercle.

This is a ball-and-socket joint formed by the articulation\\nbetween the head of the humerus and the glenoid cavity of the scapula (Figure 9.16). This joint has the largest range\\nof motion of any joint in the body. However, this freedom of movement is due to the lack of structural support and\\nthus the enhanced mobility is offset by a loss of stability.\\nFIGURE 9.16 Glenohumeral Joint The glenohumeral (shoulder) joint is a ball-and-socket joint that provides the widest range of\\nmotions. It has a loose articular capsule and is supported by ligaments and the rotator cuff muscles.\\nThe large range of motions at the shoulder joint is provided by the articulation of the large, rounded humeral head\\nwith the small and shallow glenoid cavity, which is only about one third of the size of the humeral head. The socket\\nformed by the glenoid cavity is deepened slightly by a small lip of fibrocartilage called the glenoid labrum, which\\nextends around the outer margin of the cavity. The articular capsule that surrounds the glenohumeral joint is\\nrelatively thin and loose to allow for large motions of the upper limb. Some structural support for the joint is\\nprovided by thickenings of the articular capsule wall that form weak intrinsic ligaments. These include the\\ncoracohumeral ligament, running from the coracoid process of the scapula to the anterior humerus, and three\\nligaments, each called a glenohumeral ligament, located on the anterior side of the articular capsule. These\\nligaments help to strengthen the superior and anterior capsule walls.\\nHowever, the primary support for the shoulder joint is provided by muscles crossing the joint, particularly the four\\nrotator cuff muscles. These muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) arise from the\\nscapula and attach to the greater or lesser tubercles of the humerus. As these muscles cross the shoulder joint,\\ntheir tendons encircle the head of the humerus and become fused to the anterior, superior, and posterior walls of\\nthe articular capsule. The thickening of the capsule formed by the fusion of these four muscle tendons is called the\\nrotator cuff. Two bursae, the subacromial bursa and the subscapular bursa, help to prevent friction between the\\nrotator cuff muscle tendons and the scapula as these tendons cross the glenohumeral joint. In addition to their\\nindividual actions of moving the upper limb, the rotator cuff muscles also serve to hold the head of the humerus in\\nposition within the glenoid cavity. By constantly adjusting their strength of contraction to resist forces acting on the\\nshoulder, these muscles serve as “dynamic ligaments” and thus provide the primary structural support for the\\nglenohumeral joint.\\nInjuries to the shoulder joint are common. Repetitive use of the upper limb, particularly in abduction such as during\\nthrowing, swimming, or racquet sports, may lead to acute or chronic inflammation of the bursa or muscle tendons, a\\ntear of the glenoid labrum, or degeneration or tears of the rotator cuff. Because the humeral head is strongly\\nsupported by muscles and ligaments around its anterior, superior, and posterior aspects, most dislocations of the\\nhumerus occur in an inferior direction.

Also associated with the elbow are the humeroradial joint and the\\nproximal radioulnar joint. All three of these joints are enclosed within a single articular capsule (Figure 9.17).\\nThe articular capsule of the elbow is thin on its anterior and posterior aspects, but is thickened along its outside\\nmargins by strong intrinsic ligaments. These ligaments prevent side-to-side movements and hyperextension. On the\\nmedial side is the triangular ulnar collateral ligament. This arises from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and\\nattaches to the medial side of the proximal ulna. The strongest part of this ligament is the anterior portion, which\\nresists hyperextension of the elbow. The ulnar collateral ligament may be injured by frequent, forceful extensions of\\nthe forearm, as is seen in baseball pitchers. Reconstructive surgical repair of this ligament is referred to as Tommy\\nJohn surgery, named for the former major league pitcher who was the first person to have this treatment.\\nThe lateral side of the elbow is supported by the radial collateral ligament. This arises from the lateral epicondyle\\nof the humerus and then blends into the lateral side of the annular ligament. The annular ligament encircles the\\nhead of the radius. This ligament supports the head of the radius as it articulates with the radial notch of the ulna at\\nthe proximal radioulnar joint.

The hip carries the weight of the body and thus requires strength and stability during standing and\\nwalking. For these reasons, its range of motion is more limited than at the shoulder joint.\\nThe acetabulum is the socket portion of the hip joint. This space is deep and has a large articulation area for the\\nfemoral head, thus giving stability and weight bearing ability to the joint. The acetabulum is further deepened by the\\nacetabular labrum, a fibrocartilage lip attached to the outer margin of the acetabulum. The surrounding articular\\ncapsule is strong, with several thickened areas forming intrinsic ligaments. These ligaments arise from the hip bone,\\nat the margins of the acetabulum, and attach to the femur at the base of the neck. The ligaments are the iliofemoral\\nligament, pubofemoral ligament, and ischiofemoral ligament, all of which spiral around the head and neck of the\\n9.6 • Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints 337'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 353}, page_content='femur. The ligaments are tightened by extension at the hip, thus pulling the head of the femur tightly into the\\nacetabulum when in the upright, standing position. Very little additional extension of the thigh is permitted beyond\\nthis vertical position. These ligaments thus stabilize the hip joint and allow you to maintain an upright standing\\nposition with only minimal muscle contraction. Inside of the articular capsule, the ligament of the head of the\\nfemur (ligamentum teres) spans between the acetabulum and femoral head. This intracapsular ligament is normally\\nslack and does not provide any significant joint support, but it does provide a pathway for an important artery that\\nsupplies the head of the femur.\\nThe hip is prone to osteoarthritis, and thus was the first joint for which a replacement prosthesis was developed. A\\ncommon injury in elderly individuals, particularly those with weakened bones due to osteoporosis, is a “broken hip,”\\nwhich is actually a fracture of the femoral neck. This may result from a fall, or it may cause the fall. This can happen\\nas one lower limb is taking a step and all of the body weight is placed on the other limb, causing the femoral neck to\\nbreak and producing a fall. Any accompanying disruption of the blood supply to the femoral neck or head can lead to\\nnecrosis of these areas, resulting in bone and cartilage death. Femoral fractures usually require surgical treatment,\\nafter which the patient will need mobility assistance for a prolonged period, either from family members or in a long-\\nterm care facility. Consequentially, the associated health care costs of “broken hips” are substantial. In addition, hip\\nfractures are associated with increased rates of morbidity (incidences of disease) and mortality (death). Surgery for\\na hip fracture followed by prolonged bed rest may lead to life-threatening complications, including pneumonia,\\ninfection of pressure ulcers (bedsores), and thrombophlebitis (deep vein thrombosis; blood clot formation) that can\\nresult in a pulmonary embolism (blood clot within the lung).\\n338 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The medial tibiofemoral joint and lateral\\ntibiofemoral joint are located between the medial and lateral condyles of the femur and the medial and lateral\\n9.6 • Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints 339'),\n",

All of these articulations are enclosed within a single articular capsule. The knee functions as a\\nhinge joint, allowing flexion and extension of the leg. This action is generated by both rolling and gliding motions of\\nthe femur on the tibia. In addition, some rotation of the leg is available when the knee is flexed, but not when\\nextended. The knee is well constructed for weight bearing in its extended position, but is vulnerable to injuries\\nassociated with hyperextension, twisting, or blows to the medial or lateral side of the joint, particularly while weight\\nbearing.\\nAt the femoropatellar joint, the patella slides vertically within a groove on the distal femur. The patella is a sesamoid\\nbone incorporated into the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, the large muscle of the anterior thigh. The\\npatella serves to protect the quadriceps tendon from friction against the distal femur. Continuing from the patella to\\nthe anterior tibia just below the knee is the patellar ligament. Acting via the patella and patellar ligament, the\\nquadriceps femoris is a powerful muscle that acts to extend the leg at the knee. It also serves as a “dynamic\\nligament” to provide very important support and stabilization for the knee joint.\\nThe medial and lateral tibiofemoral joints are the articulations between the rounded condyles of the femur and the\\nrelatively flat condyles of the tibia. During flexion and extension motions, the condyles of the femur both roll and\\nglide over the surfaces of the tibia. The rolling action produces flexion or extension, while the gliding action serves to\\nmaintain the femoral condyles centered over the tibial condyles, thus ensuring maximal bony, weight-bearing\\nsupport for the femur in all knee positions. As the knee comes into full extension, the femur undergoes a slight\\nmedial rotation in relation to tibia. The rotation results because the lateral condyle of the femur is slightly smaller\\nthan the medial condyle. Thus, the lateral condyle finishes its rolling motion first, followed by the medial condyle.\\nThe resulting small medial rotation of the femur serves to “lock” the knee into its fully extended and most stable\\nposition. Flexion of the knee is initiated by a slight lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia, which “unlocks” the\\nknee. This lateral rotation motion is produced by the popliteus muscle of the posterior leg.\\nLocated between the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia are two articular discs, the medial meniscus and\\nlateral meniscus (see Figure 9.19b). Each is a C-shaped fibrocartilage structure that is thin along its inside margin\\nand thick along the outer margin. They are attached to their tibial condyles, but do not attach to the femur. While\\nboth menisci are free to move during knee motions, the medial meniscus shows less movement because it is\\nanchored at its outer margin to the articular capsule and tibial collateral ligament. The menisci provide padding\\nbetween the bones and help to fill the gap between the round femoral condyles and flattened tibial condyles. Some\\nareas of each meniscus lack an arterial blood supply and thus these areas heal poorly if damaged.\\nThe knee joint has multiple ligaments that provide support, particularly in the extended position (see Figure 9.19c).\\nOutside of the articular capsule, located at the sides of the knee, are two extrinsic ligaments. The fibular collateral\\nligament (lateral collateral ligament) is on the lateral side and spans from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the\\nhead of the fibula. The tibial collateral ligament (medial collateral ligament) of the medial knee runs from the\\nmedial epicondyle of the femur to the medial tibia. As it crosses the knee, the tibial collateral ligament is firmly\\nattached on its deep side to the articular capsule and to the medial meniscus, an important factor when considering\\nknee injuries. In the fully extended knee position, both collateral ligaments are taut (tight), thus serving to stabilize\\nand support the extended knee and preventing side-to-side or rotational motions between the femur and tibia.\\nThe articular capsule of the posterior knee is thickened by intrinsic ligaments that help to resist knee\\nhyperextension. Inside the knee are two intracapsular ligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior\\ncruciate ligament. These ligaments are anchored inferiorly to the tibia at the intercondylar eminence, the\\nroughened area between the tibial condyles. The cruciate ligaments are named for whether they are attached\\nanteriorly or posteriorly to this tibial region. Each ligament runs diagonally upward to attach to the inner aspect of a\\nfemoral condyle. The cruciate ligaments are named for the X-shape formed as they pass each other (cruciate means\\n“cross”). The posterior cruciate ligament is the stronger ligament. It serves to support the knee when it is flexed and\\nweight bearing, as when walking downhill. In this position, the posterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from\\nsliding anteriorly off the top of the tibia. The anterior cruciate ligament becomes tight when the knee is extended,\\nand thus resists hyperextension.\\n340 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

What are the most common causes of anterior cruciate ligament injury?\\nAnkle and Foot Joints\\nThe ankle is formed by the talocrural joint (Figure 9.21). It consists of the articulations between the talus bone of\\nthe foot and the distal ends of the tibia and fibula of the leg (crural = “leg”). The superior aspect of the talus bone is\\nsquare-shaped and has three areas of articulation. The top of the talus articulates with the inferior tibia. This is the\\nportion of the ankle joint that carries the body weight between the leg and foot. The sides of the talus are firmly held\\nin position by the articulations with the medial malleolus of the tibia and the lateral malleolus of the fibula, which\\nthe tibia on the dashboard when not wearing a seatbelt during an automobile accident. More commonly, injuries\\noccur when forces are applied to the extended knee, particularly when the foot is planted and unable to move.\\nAnterior cruciate ligament injuries can result with a forceful blow to the anterior knee, producing\\nhyperextension, or when a runner makes a quick change of direction that produces both twisting and\\nhyperextension of the knee.\\nA worse combination of injuries can occur with a hit to the lateral side of the extended knee (Figure 9.20). A\\nmoderate blow to the lateral knee will cause the medial side of the joint to open, resulting in stretching or\\ndamage to the tibial collateral ligament. Because the medial meniscus is attached to the tibial collateral\\nligament, a stronger blow can tear the ligament and also damage the medial meniscus. This is one reason that\\nthe medial meniscus is 20 times more likely to be injured than the lateral meniscus. A powerful blow to the\\nlateral knee produces a “terrible triad” injury, in which there is a sequential injury to the tibial collateral\\nligament, medial meniscus, and anterior cruciate ligament.\\nArthroscopic surgery has greatly improved the surgical treatment of knee injuries and reduced subsequent\\nrecovery times. This procedure involves a small incision and the insertion into the joint of an arthroscope, a\\npencil-thin instrument that allows for visualization of the joint interior. Small surgical instruments are also\\ninserted via additional incisions. These tools allow a surgeon to remove or repair a torn meniscus or to\\nreconstruct a ruptured cruciate ligament. The current method for anterior cruciate ligament replacement\\ninvolves using a portion of the patellar ligament. Holes are drilled into the cruciate ligament attachment points\\non the tibia and femur, and the patellar ligament graft, with small areas of attached bone still intact at each end,\\nis inserted into these holes. The bone-to-bone sites at each end of the graft heal rapidly and strongly, thus\\nenabling a rapid recovery.\\nFIGURE 9.20 Knee Injury A strong blow to the lateral side of the extended knee will cause three injuries, in sequence: tearing of\\nthe tibial collateral ligament, damage to the medial meniscus, and rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.\\n342 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The ankle is thus a uniaxial hinge joint that allows only for dorsiflexion\\nand plantar flexion of the foot.\\nAdditional joints between the tarsal bones of the posterior foot allow for the movements of foot inversion and\\neversion. Most important for these movements is the subtalar joint, located between the talus and calcaneus\\nbones. The joints between the talus and navicular bones and the calcaneus and cuboid bones are also important\\ncontributors to these movements. All of the joints between tarsal bones are plane joints. Together, the small\\nmotions that take place at these joints all contribute to the production of inversion and eversion foot motions.\\nLike the hinge joints of the elbow and knee, the talocrural joint of the ankle is supported by several strong ligaments\\nlocated on the sides of the joint. These ligaments extend from the medial malleolus of the tibia or lateral malleolus\\nof the fibula and anchor to the talus and calcaneus bones. Since they are located on the sides of the ankle joint, they\\nallow for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the foot. They also prevent abnormal side-to-side and twisting\\nmovements of the talus and calcaneus bones during eversion and inversion of the foot. On the medial side is the\\nbroad deltoid ligament. The deltoid ligament supports the ankle joint and also resists excessive eversion of the\\nfoot. The lateral side of the ankle has several smaller ligaments. These include the anterior talofibular ligament\\nand the posterior talofibular ligament, both of which span between the talus bone and the lateral malleolus of the\\nfibula, and the calcaneofibular ligament, located between the calcaneus bone and fibula.

In the head, mesenchyme will accumulate at those areas that will become the bones that form the\\ntop and sides of the skull. The mesenchyme in these areas will develop directly into bone through the process of\\nintramembranous ossification, in which mesenchymal cells differentiate into bone-producing cells that then\\ngenerate bone tissue. The mesenchyme between the areas of bone production will become the fibrous connective\\ntissue that fills the spaces between the developing bones. Initially, the connective tissue-filled gaps between the\\nbones are wide, and are called fontanelles. After birth, as the skull bones grow and enlarge, the gaps between them\\ndecrease in width and the fontanelles are reduced to suture joints in which the bones are united by a narrow layer of\\nDisorders of the...\\nJoints\\nThe ankle is the most frequently injured joint in the body, with the most common injury being an inversion ankle\\nsprain. A sprain is the stretching or tearing of the supporting ligaments. Excess inversion causes the talus bone\\nto tilt laterally, thus damaging the ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle. The anterior talofibular ligament is\\nmost commonly injured, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament. In severe inversion injuries, the forceful\\nlateral movement of the talus not only ruptures the lateral ankle ligaments, but also fractures the distal fibula.\\nLess common are eversion sprains of the ankle, which involve stretching of the deltoid ligament on the medial\\nside of the ankle. Forcible eversion of the foot, for example, with an awkward landing from a jump or when a\\nfootball player has a foot planted and is hit on the lateral ankle, can result in a Pott’s fracture and dislocation of\\nthe ankle joint. In this injury, the very strong deltoid ligament does not tear, but instead shears off the medial\\nmalleolus of the tibia. This frees the talus, which moves laterally and fractures the distal fibula. In extreme\\ncases, the posterior margin of the tibia may also be sheared off.\\nAbove the ankle, the distal ends of the tibia and fibula are united by a strong syndesmosis formed by the\\ninterosseous membrane and ligaments at the distal tibiofibular joint. These connections prevent separation\\nbetween the distal ends of the tibia and fibula and maintain the talus locked into position between the medial\\nmalleolus and lateral malleolus. Injuries that produce a lateral twisting of the leg on top of the planted foot can\\nresult in stretching or tearing of the tibiofibular ligaments, producing a syndesmotic ankle sprain or “high ankle\\nsprain.”\\nMost ankle sprains can be treated using the RICE technique: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Reducing\\njoint mobility using a brace or cast may be required for a period of time. More severe injuries involving ligament\\ntears or bone fractures may require surgery.\\n344 9 • Joints\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In this process, mesenchyme accumulates and differentiates into hyaline cartilage, which forms a\\nmodel of the future bone. The hyaline cartilage model is then gradually, over a period of many years, displaced by\\nbone. The mesenchyme between these developing bones becomes the fibrous connective tissue of the suture joints\\nbetween the bones in these regions of the skull.\\nA similar process of endochondral ossification gives rises to the bones and joints of the limbs. The limbs initially\\ndevelop as small limb buds that appear on the sides of the embryo around the end of the fourth week of\\ndevelopment. Starting during the sixth week, as each limb bud continues to grow and elongate, areas of\\nmesenchyme within the bud begin to differentiate into the hyaline cartilage that will form models for of each of the\\nfuture bones. The synovial joints will form between the adjacent cartilage models, in an area called the joint\\ninterzone. Cells at the center of this interzone region undergo cell death to form the joint cavity, while surrounding\\nmesenchyme cells will form the articular capsule and supporting ligaments. The process of endochondral\\nossification, which converts the cartilage models into bone, begins by the twelfth week of embryonic development.\\nAt birth, ossification of much of the bone has occurred, but the hyaline cartilage of the epiphyseal plate will remain\\nthroughout childhood and adolescence to allow for bone lengthening.

At fibrous joints, the adjacent bones are\\ndirectly united to each other by fibrous connective\\ntissue. Similarly, at a cartilaginous joint, the adjacent\\nbones are united by cartilage. In contrast, at a synovial\\njoint, the articulating bone surfaces are not directly\\nunited to each other, but come together within a fluid-\\nfilled joint cavity.\\nThe functional classification of body joints is based on\\nthe degree of movement found at each joint. A\\nsynarthrosis is a joint that is essentially immobile. This\\ntype of joint provides for a strong connection between\\nthe adjacent bones, which serves to protect internal\\nstructures such as the brain or heart. Examples include\\nthe fibrous joints of the skull sutures and the\\ncartilaginous manubriosternal joint. A joint that allows\\nfor limited movement is an amphiarthrosis. An example\\nis the pubic symphysis of the pelvis, the cartilaginous\\njoint that strongly unites the right and left hip bones of\\nthe pelvis. The cartilaginous joints in which vertebrae\\nare united by intervertebral discs provide for small\\nmovements between the adjacent vertebrae and are\\nalso an amphiarthrosis type of joint. Thus, based on\\ntheir movement ability, both fibrous and cartilaginous\\njoints are functionally classified as a synarthrosis or\\namphiarthrosis.\\nThe most common type of joint is the diarthrosis, which\\nis a freely moveable joint. All synovial joints are\\nfunctionally classified as diarthroses. A uniaxial\\ndiarthrosis, such as the elbow, is a joint that only\\nallows for movement within a single anatomical plane.\\nJoints that allow for movements in two planes are\\nbiaxial joints, such as the metacarpophalangeal joints\\nof the fingers. A multiaxial joint, such as the shoulder\\nor hip joint, allows for three planes of motions.\\n9.2 Fibrous Joints\\nFibrous joints are where adjacent bones are strongly\\nunited by fibrous connective tissue. The gap filled by\\nconnective tissue may be narrow or wide. The three\\ntypes of fibrous joints are sutures, gomphoses, and\\nsyndesmoses. A suture is the narrow fibrous joint that\\nunites most bones of the skull. At a gomphosis, the\\nroot of a tooth is anchored across a narrow gap by\\nperiodontal ligaments to the walls of its socket in the\\nbony jaw. A syndesmosis is the type of fibrous joint\\nfound between parallel bones. The gap between the\\nbones may be wide and filled with a fibrous\\ninterosseous membrane, or it may narrow with\\nligaments spanning between the bones. Syndesmoses\\nare found between the bones of the forearm (radius\\nand ulna) and the leg (tibia and fibula). Fibrous joints\\nstrongly unite adjacent bones and thus serve to provide\\nprotection for internal organs, strength to body regions,\\nor weight-bearing stability.\\n9 • Chapter Review 349'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 365}, page_content='9.3 Cartilaginous Joints\\nThere are two types of cartilaginous joints. A\\nsynchondrosis is formed when the adjacent bones are\\nunited by hyaline cartilage. A temporary synchondrosis\\nis formed by the epiphyseal plate of a growing long\\nbone, which is lost when the epiphyseal plate ossifies\\nas the bone reaches maturity. The synchondrosis is\\nthus replaced by a synostosis. Permanent\\nsynchondroses that do not ossify are found at the first\\nsternocostal joint and between the anterior ends of the\\nbony ribs and the junction with their costal cartilage. A\\nsymphysis is where the bones are joined by\\nfibrocartilage and the gap between the bones may be\\nnarrow or wide. A narrow symphysis is found at the\\nmanubriosternal joint and at the pubic symphysis. A\\nwide symphysis is the intervertebral symphysis in\\nwhich the bodies of adjacent vertebrae are united by\\nan intervertebral disc.\\n9.4 Synovial Joints\\nSynovial joints are the most common type of joints in\\nthe body. They are characterized by the presence of a\\njoint cavity, inside of which the bones of the joint\\narticulate with each other. The articulating surfaces of\\nthe bones at a synovial joint are not directly connected\\nto each other by connective tissue or cartilage, which\\nallows the bones to move freely against each other. The\\nwalls of the joint cavity are formed by the articular\\ncapsule. Friction between the bones is reduced by a\\nthin layer of articular cartilage covering the surfaces of\\nthe bones, and by a lubricating synovial fluid, which is\\nsecreted by the synovial membrane.\\nSynovial joints are strengthened by the presence of\\nligaments, which hold the bones together and resist\\nexcessive or abnormal movements of the joint.\\nLigaments are classified as extrinsic ligaments if they\\nare located outside of the articular capsule, intrinsic\\nligaments if they are fused to the wall of the articular\\ncapsule, or intracapsular ligaments if they are located\\ninside the articular capsule. Some synovial joints also\\nhave an articular disc (meniscus), which can provide\\npadding between the bones, smooth their movements,\\nor strongly join the bones together to strengthen the\\njoint. Muscles and their tendons acting across a joint\\ncan also increase their contractile strength when\\nneeded, thus providing indirect support for the joint.\\nBursae contain a lubricating fluid that serves to reduce\\nfriction between structures. Subcutaneous bursae\\nprevent friction between the skin and an underlying\\nbone, submuscular bursae protect muscles from\\nrubbing against a bone or another muscle, and a\\nsubtendinous bursa prevents friction between bone\\nand a muscle tendon. Tendon sheaths contain a\\nlubricating fluid and surround tendons to allow for\\nsmooth movement of the tendon as it crosses a joint.\\nBased on the shape of the articulating bone surfaces\\nand the types of movement allowed, synovial joints are\\nclassified into six types. At a pivot joint, one bone is\\nheld within a ring by a ligament and its articulation with\\na second bone. Pivot joints only allow for rotation\\naround a single axis. These are found at the articulation\\nbetween the C1 (atlas) and the dens of the C2 (axis)\\nvertebrae, which provides the side-to-side rotation of\\nthe head, or at the proximal radioulnar joint between\\nthe head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna,\\nwhich allows for rotation of the radius during forearm\\nmovements. Hinge joints, such as at the elbow, knee,\\nankle, or interphalangeal joints between phalanx bones\\nof the fingers and toes, allow only for bending and\\nstraightening of the joint. Pivot and hinge joints are\\nfunctionally classified as uniaxial joints.\\nCondyloid joints are found where the shallow\\ndepression of one bone receives a rounded bony area\\nformed by one or two bones. Condyloid joints are found\\nat the base of the fingers (metacarpophalangeal joints)\\nand at the wrist (radiocarpal joint). At a saddle joint,\\nthe articulating bones fit together like a rider and a\\nsaddle. An example is the first carpometacarpal joint\\nlocated at the base of the thumb. Both condyloid and\\nsaddle joints are functionally classified as biaxial joints.\\nPlane joints are formed between the small, flattened\\nsurfaces of adjacent bones. These joints allow the\\nbones to slide or rotate against each other, but the\\nrange of motion is usually slight and tightly limited by\\nligaments or surrounding bones. This type of joint is\\nfound between the articular processes of adjacent\\nvertebrae, at the acromioclavicular joint, or at the\\nintercarpal joints of the hand and intertarsal joints of\\nthe foot. Ball-and-socket joints, in which the rounded\\nhead of a bone fits into a large depression or socket,\\nare found at the shoulder and hip joints. Both plane\\nand ball-and-sockets joints are classified functionally\\nas multiaxial joints. However, ball-and-socket joints\\nallow for large movements, while the motions between\\nbones at a plane joint are small.\\n9.5 Types of Body Movements\\nThe variety of movements provided by the different\\ntypes of synovial joints allows for a large range of body\\nmotions and gives you tremendous mobility. These\\nmovements allow you to flex or extend your body or\\nlimbs, medially rotate and adduct your arms and flex\\nyour elbows to hold a heavy object against your chest,\\nraise your arms above your head, rotate or shake your\\n350 9 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The atlantoaxial pivot\\njoint provides side-to-side rotation of the head, while\\nthe proximal radioulnar articulation allows for rotation\\nof the radius during pronation and supination of the\\nforearm. Hinge joints, such as at the knee and elbow,\\nallow only for flexion and extension. Similarly, the hinge\\njoint of the ankle only allows for dorsiflexion and\\nplantar flexion of the foot.\\nCondyloid and saddle joints are biaxial. These allow for\\nflexion and extension, and abduction and adduction.\\nThe sequential combination of flexion, adduction,\\nextension, and abduction produces circumduction.\\nMultiaxial plane joints provide for only small motions,\\nbut these can add together over several adjacent joints\\nto produce body movement, such as inversion and\\neversion of the foot. Similarly, plane joints allow for\\nflexion, extension, and lateral flexion movements of the\\nvertebral column. The multiaxial ball and socket joints\\nallow for flexion-extension, abduction-adduction, and\\ncircumduction. In addition, these also allow for medial\\n(internal) and lateral (external) rotation. Ball-and-\\nsocket joints have the greatest range of motion of all\\nsynovial joints.\\n9.6 Anatomy of Selected Synovial Joints\\nAlthough synovial joints share many common features,\\neach joint of the body is specialized for certain\\nmovements and activities. The joints of the upper limb\\nprovide for large ranges of motion, which give the\\nupper limb great mobility, thus enabling actions such\\nas the throwing of a ball or typing on a keyboard. The\\njoints of the lower limb are more robust, giving them\\ngreater strength and the stability needed to support\\nthe body weight during running, jumping, or kicking\\nactivities.\\nThe joints of the vertebral column include the\\nsymphysis joints formed by each intervertebral disc\\nand the plane synovial joints between the superior and\\ninferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae. Each\\nof these joints provide for limited motions, but these\\nsum together to produce flexion, extension, lateral\\nflexion, and rotation of the neck and body. The range of\\nmotions available in each region of the vertebral\\ncolumn varies, with all of these motions available in the\\ncervical region. Only rotation is allowed in the thoracic\\nregion, while the lumbar region has considerable\\nextension, flexion, and lateral flexion, but rotation is\\nprevented. The atlanto-occipital joint allows for flexion\\nand extension of the head, while the atlantoaxial joint\\nis a pivot joint that provides for rotation of the head.\\nThe temporomandibular joint is the articulation\\nbetween the condyle of the mandible and the\\nmandibular fossa and articular tubercle of the skull\\ntemporal bone. An articular disc is located between the\\nbony components of this joint. A combination of gliding\\nand hinge motions of the mandibular condyle allows\\nfor elevation/depression, protraction/retraction, and\\nside-to-side motions of the lower jaw.\\nThe glenohumeral (shoulder) joint is a multiaxial ball-\\nand-socket joint that provides flexion/extension,\\nabduction/adduction, circumduction, and medial/\\nlateral rotation of the humerus. The head of the\\nhumerus articulates with the glenoid cavity of the\\nscapula. The glenoid labrum extends around the\\nmargin of the glenoid cavity. Intrinsic ligaments,\\nincluding the coracohumeral ligament and\\nglenohumeral ligaments, provide some support for the\\nshoulder joint. However, the primary support comes\\nfrom muscles crossing the joint whose tendons form\\nthe rotator cuff. These muscle tendons are protected\\nfrom friction against the scapula by the subacromial\\nbursa and subscapular bursa.\\nThe elbow is a uniaxial hinge joint that allows for\\nflexion/extension of the forearm. It includes the\\nhumeroulnar joint and the humeroradial joint. The\\nmedial elbow is supported by the ulnar collateral\\nligament and the radial collateral ligament supports\\nthe lateral side. These ligaments prevent side-to-side\\nmovements and resist hyperextension of the elbow.\\nThe proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot joint that allows\\nfor rotation of the radius during pronation/supination of\\nthe forearm. The annular ligament surrounds the head\\nof the radius to hold it in place at this joint.\\nThe hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint whose motions\\nare more restricted than at the shoulder to provide\\ngreater stability during weight bearing. The hip joint is\\nthe articulation between the head of the femur and the\\nacetabulum of the hip bone. The acetabulum is\\ndeepened by the acetabular labrum. The iliofemoral,\\npubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments strongly\\nsupport the hip joint in the upright, standing position.\\nThe ligament of the head of the femur provides little\\nsupport but carries an important artery that supplies\\nthe femur.\\nThe knee includes three articulations. The\\nfemoropatellar joint is between the patella and distal\\nfemur. The patella, a sesamoid bone incorporated into\\nthe tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle of the\\nanterior thigh, serves to protect this tendon from\\nrubbing against the distal femur during knee\\n9 • Chapter Review 351'),\n",

The medial and lateral tibiofemoral joints,\\nbetween the condyles of the femur and condyles of the\\ntibia, are modified hinge joints that allow for knee\\nextension and flexion. During these movements, the\\ncondyles of the femur both roll and glide over the\\nsurface of the tibia. As the knee comes into full\\nextension, a slight medial rotation of the femur serves\\nto “lock” the knee into its most stable, weight-bearing\\nposition. The reverse motion, a small lateral rotation of\\nthe femur, is required to initiate knee flexion. When the\\nknee is flexed, some rotation of the leg is available.\\nTwo extrinsic ligaments, the tibial collateral ligament\\non the medial side and the fibular collateral ligament\\non the lateral side, serve to resist hyperextension or\\nrotation of the extended knee joint. Two intracapsular\\nligaments, the anterior cruciate ligament and posterior\\ncruciate ligament, span between the tibia and the inner\\naspects of the femoral condyles. The anterior cruciate\\nligament resists hyperextension of the knee, while the\\nposterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior sliding of\\nthe femur, thus supporting the knee when it is flexed\\nand weight bearing. The medial and lateral menisci,\\nlocated between the femoral and tibial condyles, are\\narticular discs that provide padding and improve the fit\\nbetween the bones.\\nThe talocrural joint forms the ankle. It consists of the\\narticulation between the talus bone and the medial\\nmalleolus of the tibia, the distal end of the tibia, and\\nthe lateral malleolus of the fibula. This is a uniaxial\\nhinge joint that allows only dorsiflexion and plantar\\nflexion of the foot. Gliding motions at the subtalar and\\nintertarsal joints of the foot allow for inversion/eversion\\nof the foot. The ankle joint is supported on the medial\\nside by the deltoid ligament, which prevents side-to-\\nside motions of the talus at the talocrural joint and\\nresists excessive eversion of the foot. The lateral ankle\\nis supported by the anterior and posterior talofibular\\nligaments and the calcaneofibular ligament. These\\nsupport the ankle joint and also resist excess inversion\\nof the foot. An inversion ankle sprain, a common injury,\\nwill result in injury to one or more of these lateral ankle\\nligaments.\\n9.7 Development of Joints\\nDuring embryonic growth, bones and joints develop\\nfrom mesenchyme, an embryonic tissue that gives rise\\nto bone, cartilage, and fibrous connective tissues. In\\nthe skull, the bones develop either directly from\\nmesenchyme through the process of intramembranous\\nossification, or indirectly through endochondral\\nossification, which initially forms a hyaline cartilage\\nmodel of the future bone, which is later converted into\\nbone. In both cases, the mesenchyme between the\\ndeveloping bones differentiates into fibrous connective\\ntissue that will unite the skull bones at suture joints. In\\nthe limbs, mesenchyme accumulations within the\\ngrowing limb bud will become a hyaline cartilage model\\nfor each of the limb bones. A joint interzone will\\ndevelop between these areas of cartilage.\\nMesenchyme cells at the margins of the interzone will\\ngive rise to the articular capsule, while cell death at the\\ncenter forms the space that will become the joint cavity\\nof the future synovial joint. The hyaline cartilage model\\nof each limb bone will eventually be converted into\\nbone via the process of endochondral ossification.\\nHowever, hyaline cartilage will remain, covering the\\nends of the adult bone as the articular cartilage.\\nInteractive Link Questions\\n1.

These are skeletal muscles, so-named because most of them move the skeleton. But there\\nare two other types of muscle in the body, with distinctly different jobs. Cardiac muscle, found in the heart, is\\nconcerned with pumping blood through the circulatory system. Smooth muscle is concerned with various\\ninvoluntary movements, such as having one’s hair stand on end when cold or frightened, or moving food through the\\ndigestive system. This chapter will examine the structure and function of these three types of muscles.\\n10.1 Overview of Muscle Tissues\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the different types of muscle\\n• Explain contractibility and extensibility\\nMuscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body, and the body contains three types of muscle tissue:\\nskeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (Figure 10.2). All three muscle tissues have some properties in\\ncommon; they all exhibit a quality called excitability as their plasma membranes can change their electrical states\\nFigure 10.1 Tennis Player Athletes rely on toned skeletal muscles to supply the force required for movement.

While the nervous system can influence the excitability of cardiac and smooth muscle to some degree,\\nskeletal muscle completely depends on signaling from the nervous system to work properly. On the other hand, both\\ncardiac muscle and smooth muscle can respond to other stimuli, such as hormones and local stimuli.\\nFIGURE 10.2 The Three Types of Muscle Tissue The body contains three types of muscle tissue: (a) skeletal muscle, (b) smooth\\nmuscle, and (c) cardiac muscle. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\\nThe muscles all begin the actual process of contracting (shortening) when a protein called actin is pulled by a\\nprotein called myosin. This occurs in striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac) after specific binding sites on the actin\\nhave been exposed in response to the interaction between calcium ions (Ca++) and proteins (troponin and\\ntropomyosin) that “shield” the actin-binding sites. Ca++ also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle,\\nalthough its role is different: here Ca++ activates enzymes, which in turn activate myosin heads. All muscles require\\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) to continue the process of contracting, and they all relax when the Ca++ is removed\\nand the actin-binding sites are re-shielded.\\nA muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue called elasticity. It can\\nrecoil back to its original length due to elastic fibers. Muscle tissue also has the quality of extensibility; it can\\nstretch or extend. Contractility allows muscle tissue to pull on its attachment points and shorten with force.\\nDifferences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins—actin\\nand myosin. The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells\\n(referred to as fibers) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, which creates a pattern, or stripes, called\\nstriations. The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification (see Figure 10.2). Skeletal\\n358 10 • Muscle Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Cardiac muscle fibers each have\\none to two nuclei and are physically and electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as\\none unit (called a syncytium).\\nBecause the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle, the cytoplasm of a\\nsmooth muscle fiber (which has only a single nucleus) has a uniform, nonstriated appearance (resulting in the name\\nsmooth muscle). However, the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less\\nefficient. Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to\\npush blood through the circulatory system; and smooth muscle in the skin, visceral organs, and internal\\npassageways is essential for moving all materials through the body.\\n10.2 Skeletal Muscle\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the layers of connective tissues packaging skeletal muscle\\n• Explain how muscles work with tendons to move the body\\n• Identify areas of the skeletal muscle fibers\\n• Describe excitation-contraction coupling\\nThe best-known feature of skeletal muscle is its ability to contract and cause movement. Skeletal muscles act not\\nonly to produce movement but also to stop movement, such as resisting gravity to maintain posture. Small, constant\\nadjustments of the skeletal muscles are needed to hold a body upright or balanced in any position. Muscles also\\nprevent excess movement of the bones and joints, maintaining skeletal stability and preventing skeletal structure\\ndamage or deformation. Joints can become misaligned or dislocated entirely by pulling on the associated bones;\\nmuscles work to keep joints stable. Skeletal muscles are located throughout the body at the openings of internal\\ntracts to control the movement of various substances. These muscles allow functions, such as swallowing, urination,\\nand defecation, to be under voluntary control. Skeletal muscles also protect internal organs (particularly abdominal\\nand pelvic organs) by acting as an external barrier or shield to external trauma and by supporting the weight of the\\norgans.\\nSkeletal muscles contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in the body by generating heat. Muscle contraction\\nrequires energy, and when ATP is broken down, heat is produced. This heat is very noticeable during exercise, when\\nsustained muscle movement causes body temperature to rise, and in cases of extreme cold, when shivering\\nproduces random skeletal muscle contractions to generate heat.\\nEach skeletal muscle is an organ that consists of various integrated tissues. These tissues include the skeletal\\nmuscle fibers, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and connective tissue. Each skeletal muscle has three layers of\\nconnective tissue (called “mysia”) that enclose it and provide structure to the muscle as a whole, and also\\ncompartmentalize the muscle fibers within the muscle (Figure 10.3). Each muscle is wrapped in a sheath of dense,\\nirregular connective tissue called the epimysium, which allows a muscle to contract and move powerfully while\\nmaintaining its structural integrity. The epimysium also separates muscle from other tissues and organs in the area,\\nallowing the muscle to move independently.\\n10.2 • Skeletal Muscle 359'),\n",

This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs; it\\nallows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within\\na bundle, or fascicle of the muscle. Inside each fascicle, each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue\\nlayer of collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium. The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and\\nnutrients to support the muscle fiber. These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue.\\nIn skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones, the collagen in the three tissue layers (the mysia)\\nintertwines with the collagen of a tendon. At the other end of the tendon, it fuses with the periosteum coating the\\nbone. The tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia, to the tendon,\\nand then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton.

This is referred to as a cell’s membrane potential.\\nNeurons and muscle cells can use their membrane potentials to generate electrical signals. They do this by\\ncontrolling the movement of charged particles, called ions, across their membranes to create electrical currents.\\nThis is achieved by opening and closing specialized proteins in the membrane called ion channels. Although the\\ncurrents generated by ions moving through these channel proteins are very small, they form the basis of both neural\\nsignaling and muscle contraction.\\nBoth neurons and skeletal muscle cells are electrically excitable, meaning that they are able to generate action\\npotentials. An action potential is a special type of electrical signal that can travel along a cell membrane as a wave.\\nThis allows a signal to be transmitted quickly and faithfully over long distances.\\nAlthough the term excitation-contraction coupling confuses or scares some students, it comes down to this: for a\\nskeletal muscle fiber to contract, its membrane must first be “excited”—in other words, it must be stimulated to fire\\nan action potential.

There are three mechanisms by which ATP can be regenerated in muscle cells:\\ncreatine phosphate metabolism, anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic respiration.\\nCreatine phosphate is a molecule that can store energy in its phosphate bonds. In a resting muscle, excess ATP\\ntransfers its energy to creatine, producing ADP and creatine phosphate. This acts as an energy reserve that can be\\nused to quickly create more ATP. When the muscle starts to contract and needs energy, creatine phosphate\\ntransfers its phosphate back to ADP to form ATP and creatine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine\\nkinase and occurs very quickly; thus, creatine phosphate-derived ATP powers the first few seconds of muscle\\ncontraction.

Glycolysis is\\nan anaerobic (non-oxygen-dependent) process that breaks down glucose (sugar) to produce ATP; however,\\nglycolysis cannot generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate. Thus, the switch to glycolysis results in a slower\\nrate of ATP availability to the muscle. The sugar used in glycolysis can be provided by blood glucose or by\\nmetabolizing glycogen that is stored in the muscle. The breakdown of one glucose molecule produces two ATP and\\ntwo molecules of pyruvic acid, which can be used in aerobic respiration or when oxygen levels are low, converted to\\nlactic acid (Figure 10.12b).\\nIf oxygen is available, pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration. However, if oxygen is not available, pyruvic acid is\\nconverted to lactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue. This conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme\\nNAD+ from NADH, which is needed for glycolysis to continue. This occurs during strenuous exercise when high\\namounts of energy are needed but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to muscle. Glycolysis itself cannot be\\nsustained for very long (approximately 1 minute of muscle activity), but it is useful in facilitating short bursts of high-\\nintensity output. This is because glycolysis does not utilize glucose very efficiently, producing a net gain of two ATPs\\nper molecule of glucose, and the end product of lactic acid, which may contribute to muscle fatigue as it\\naccumulates.\\nAerobic respiration is the breakdown of glucose or other nutrients in the presence of oxygen (O2) to produce carbon\\ndioxide, water, and ATP.

Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than\\nanaerobic glycolysis, producing approximately 36 ATPs per molecule of glucose versus four from glycolysis.\\nHowever, aerobic respiration cannot be sustained without a steady supply of O2 to the skeletal muscle and is much\\nslower (Figure 10.12c). To compensate, muscles store small amount of excess oxygen in proteins call myoglobin,\\nallowing for more efficient muscle contractions and less fatigue. Aerobic training also increases the efficiency of the\\ncirculatory system so that O2 can be supplied to the muscles for longer periods of time.\\nMuscle fatigue occurs when a muscle can no longer contract in response to signals from the nervous system. The\\nexact causes of muscle fatigue are not fully known, although certain factors have been correlated with the\\ndecreased muscle contraction that occurs during fatigue. ATP is needed for normal muscle contraction, and as ATP\\nreserves are reduced, muscle function may decline. This may be more of a factor in brief, intense muscle output\\nrather than sustained, lower intensity efforts. Lactic acid buildup may lower intracellular pH, affecting enzyme and\\nprotein activity. Imbalances in Na+ and K+ levels as a result of membrane depolarization may disrupt Ca++ flow out\\nof the SR. Long periods of sustained exercise may damage the SR and the sarcolemma, resulting in impaired Ca++\\nregulation.\\nIntense muscle activity results in an oxygen debt, which is the amount of oxygen needed to compensate for ATP\\nproduced without oxygen during muscle contraction. Oxygen is required to restore ATP and creatine phosphate\\nlevels, convert lactic acid to pyruvic acid, and, in the liver, to convert lactic acid into glucose or glycogen. Other\\nsystems used during exercise also require oxygen, and all of these combined processes result in the increased\\nbreathing rate that occurs after exercise. Until the oxygen debt has been met, oxygen intake is elevated, even after\\nexercise has stopped.\\nRelaxation of a Skeletal Muscle\\nRelaxing skeletal muscle fibers, and ultimately, the skeletal muscle, begins with the motor neuron, which stops\\nreleasing its chemical signal, ACh, into the synapse at the NMJ. The muscle fiber will repolarize, which closes the\\ngates in the SR where Ca++ was being released. ATP-driven pumps will move Ca++ out of the sarcoplasm back into\\nthe SR. This results in the “reshielding” of the actin-binding sites on the thin filaments. Without the ability to form\\ncross-bridges between the thin and thick filaments, the muscle fiber loses its tension and relaxes.\\nMuscle Strength\\nThe number of skeletal muscle fibers in a given muscle is genetically determined and does not change. Muscle\\nstrength is directly related to the amount of myofibrils and sarcomeres within each fiber. Factors, such as hormones\\nand stress (and artificial anabolic steroids), acting on the muscle can increase the production of sarcomeres and\\nmyofibrils within the muscle fibers, a change called hypertrophy, which results in the increased mass and bulk in a\\nskeletal muscle. Likewise, decreased use of a skeletal muscle results in atrophy, where the number of sarcomeres\\nand myofibrils disappear (but not the number of muscle fibers). It is common for a limb in a cast to show atrophied\\nmuscles when the cast is removed, and certain diseases, such as polio, show atrophied muscles.\\nDisorders of the...\\nMuscular System\\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive weakening of the skeletal muscles. It is one of several\\ndiseases collectively referred to as “muscular dystrophy.” DMD is caused by a lack of the protein dystrophin,\\nwhich helps the thin filaments of myofibrils bind to the sarcolemma. Without sufficient dystrophin, muscle\\ncontractions cause the sarcolemma to tear, causing an influx of Ca++, leading to cellular damage and muscle\\nfiber degradation. Over time, as muscle damage accumulates, muscle mass is lost, and greater functional\\nimpairments develop.\\nDMD is an inherited disorder caused by an abnormal X chromosome. It primarily affects males, and it is usually\\ndiagnosed in early childhood. DMD usually first appears as difficulty with balance and motion, and then\\nprogresses to an inability to walk. It continues progressing upward in the body from the lower extremities to the\\nupper body, where it affects the muscles responsible for breathing and circulation. It ultimately causes death\\ndue to respiratory failure, and those afflicted do not usually live past their 20s.\\n10.3 • Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation 371'),\n",

The\\nforce generated by the contraction of the muscle (or shortening of the sarcomeres) is called muscle tension.\\nHowever, muscle tension also is generated when the muscle is contracting against a load that does not move,\\nresulting in two main types of skeletal muscle contractions: isotonic contractions and isometric contractions.\\nIn isotonic contractions, where the tension in the muscle stays constant, a load is moved as the length of the\\nmuscle changes (shortens). There are two types of isotonic contractions: concentric and eccentric. A concentric\\ncontraction involves the muscle shortening to move a load. An example of this is the biceps brachii muscle\\ncontracting when a hand weight is brought upward with increasing muscle tension. As the biceps brachii contract,\\nthe angle of the elbow joint decreases as the forearm is brought toward the body. Here, the biceps brachii contracts\\nas sarcomeres in its muscle fibers are shortening and cross-bridges form; the myosin heads pull the actin. An\\neccentric contraction occurs as the muscle tension diminishes and the muscle lengthens. In this case, the hand\\nweight is lowered in a slow and controlled manner as the amount of cross-bridges being activated by nervous\\nsystem stimulation decreases. In this case, as tension is released from the biceps brachii, the angle of the elbow\\njoint increases. Eccentric contractions are also used for movement and balance of the body.\\nAn isometric contraction occurs as the muscle produces tension without changing the angle of a skeletal joint.\\nIsometric contractions involve sarcomere shortening and increasing muscle tension, but do not move a load, as the\\nforce produced cannot overcome the resistance provided by the load. For example, if one attempts to lift a hand\\nweight that is too heavy, there will be sarcomere activation and shortening to a point, and ever-increasing muscle\\ntension, but no change in the angle of the elbow joint. In everyday living, isometric contractions are active in\\nmaintaining posture and maintaining bone and joint stability. However, holding your head in an upright position\\noccurs not because the muscles cannot move the head, but because the goal is to remain stationary and not\\nproduce movement. Most actions of the body are the result of a combination of isotonic and isometric contractions\\nworking together to produce a wide range of outcomes (Figure 10.13).\\nBecause DMD is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin, it was thought that introducing\\nhealthy myoblasts into patients might be an effective treatment. Myoblasts are the embryonic cells responsible\\nfor muscle development, and ideally, they would carry healthy genes that could produce the dystrophin needed\\nfor normal muscle contraction. This approach has been largely unsuccessful in humans. A recent approach has\\ninvolved attempting to boost the muscle’s production of utrophin, a protein similar to dystrophin that may be\\nable to assume the role of dystrophin and prevent cellular damage from occurring.\\n372 10 • Muscle Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Neural control regulates\\nconcentric, eccentric and isometric contractions, muscle fiber recruitment, and muscle tone. A crucial aspect of\\nnervous system control of skeletal muscles is the role of motor units.\\nMotor Units\\nAs you have learned, every skeletal muscle fiber must be innervated by the axon terminal of a motor neuron in order\\nto contract. Each muscle fiber is innervated by only one motor neuron. The actual group of muscle fibers in a muscle\\ninnervated by a single motor neuron is called a motor unit. The size of a motor unit is variable depending on the\\nnature of the muscle.\\nA small motor unit is an arrangement where a single motor neuron supplies a small number of muscle fibers in a\\nmuscle. Small motor units permit very fine motor control of the muscle. The best example in humans is the small\\nmotor units of the extraocular eye muscles that move the eyeballs. There are thousands of muscle fibers in each\\nmuscle, but every six or so fibers are supplied by a single motor neuron, as the axons branch to form synaptic\\nconnections at their individual NMJs. This allows for exquisite control of eye movements so that both eyes can\\nquickly focus on the same object. Small motor units are also involved in the many fine movements of the fingers and\\nthumb of the hand for grasping, texting, etc.\\n10.4 • Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension 373'),\n",

Large motor units are concerned with simple, or “gross,” movements, such as powerfully extending the\\nknee joint. The best example is the large motor units of the thigh muscles or back muscles, where a single motor\\nneuron will supply thousands of muscle fibers in a muscle, as its axon splits into thousands of branches.\\nThere is a wide range of motor units within many skeletal muscles, which gives the nervous system a wide range of\\ncontrol over the muscle. The small motor units in the muscle will have smaller, lower-threshold motor neurons that\\nare more excitable, firing first to their skeletal muscle fibers, which also tend to be the smallest. Activation of these\\nsmaller motor units, results in a relatively small degree of contractile strength (tension) generated in the muscle. As\\nmore strength is needed, larger motor units, with bigger, higher-threshold motor neurons are enlisted to activate\\nlarger muscle fibers. This increasing activation of motor units produces an increase in muscle contraction known as\\nrecruitment. As more motor units are recruited, the muscle contraction grows progressively stronger. In some\\nmuscles, the largest motor units may generate a contractile force of 50 times more than the smallest motor units in\\nthe muscle. This allows a feather to be picked up using the biceps brachii arm muscle with minimal force, and a\\nheavy weight to be lifted by the same muscle by recruiting the largest motor units.\\nWhen necessary, the maximal number of motor units in a muscle can be recruited simultaneously, producing the\\nmaximum force of contraction for that muscle, but this cannot last for very long because of the energy requirements\\nto sustain the contraction. To prevent complete muscle fatigue, motor units are generally not all simultaneously\\nactive, but instead some motor units rest while others are active, which allows for longer muscle contractions. The\\nnervous system uses recruitment as a mechanism to efficiently utilize a skeletal muscle.\\nThe Length-Tension Range of a Sarcomere\\nWhen a skeletal muscle fiber contracts, myosin heads attach to actin to form cross-bridges followed by the thin\\nfilaments sliding over the thick filaments as the heads pull the actin, and this results in sarcomere shortening,\\ncreating the tension of the muscle contraction. The cross-bridges can only form where thin and thick filaments\\nalready overlap, so that the length of the sarcomere has a direct influence on the force generated when the\\nsarcomere shortens. This is called the length-tension relationship.\\nThe ideal length of a sarcomere to produce maximal tension occurs at 80 percent to 120 percent of its resting\\nlength, with 100 percent being the state where the medial edges of the thin filaments are just at the most-medial\\nmyosin heads of the thick filaments (Figure 10.14). This length maximizes the overlap of actin-binding sites and\\nmyosin heads. If a sarcomere is stretched past this ideal length (beyond 120 percent), thick and thin filaments do\\nnot overlap sufficiently, which results in less tension produced. If a sarcomere is shortened beyond 80 percent, the\\nzone of overlap is reduced with the thin filaments jutting beyond the last of the myosin heads and shrinks the H\\nzone, which is normally composed of myosin tails. Eventually, there is nowhere else for the thin filaments to go and\\nthe amount of tension is diminished. If the muscle is stretched to the point where thick and thin filaments do not\\noverlap at all, no cross-bridges can be formed, and no tension is produced in that sarcomere. This amount of\\nstretching does not usually occur, as accessory proteins and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.\\n374 10 • Muscle Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A twitch can last for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds, depending\\non the muscle type. The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by a myogram, an instrument that\\nmeasures the amount of tension produced over time (Figure 10.15). Each twitch undergoes three phases. The first\\nphase is the latent period, during which the action potential is being propagated along the sarcolemma and Ca++\\nions are released from the SR. This is the phase during which excitation and contraction are being coupled but\\ncontraction has yet to occur. The contraction phase occurs next. The Ca++ ions in the sarcoplasm have bound to\\ntroponin, tropomyosin has shifted away from actin-binding sites, cross-bridges have formed, and sarcomeres are\\nactively shortening to the point of peak tension. The last phase is the relaxation phase, when tension decreases as\\ncontraction stops.

The\\nfrequency of action potentials (nerve impulses) from a motor neuron and the number of motor neurons transmitting\\naction potentials both affect the tension produced in skeletal muscle.\\nThe rate at which a motor neuron fires action potentials affects the tension produced in the skeletal muscle. If the\\nfibers are stimulated while a previous twitch is still occurring, the second twitch will be stronger. This response is\\ncalled wave summation, because the excitation-contraction coupling effects of successive motor neuron signaling\\nis summed, or added together (Figure 10.16a). At the molecular level, summation occurs because the second\\nstimulus triggers the release of more Ca++ ions, which become available to activate additional sarcomeres while the\\nmuscle is still contracting from the first stimulus.

Using these criteria, there are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers. Slow\\noxidative (SO) fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration (oxygen and glucose) to produce ATP.\\nFast oxidative (FO) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration, but because they may switch\\nto anaerobic respiration (glycolysis), can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers. Lastly, fast glycolytic (FG) fibers have\\nfast contractions and primarily use anaerobic glycolysis. The FG fibers fatigue more quickly than the others. Most\\nskeletal muscles in a human contain(s) all three types, although in varying proportions.\\nThe speed of contraction is dependent on how quickly myosin’s ATPase hydrolyzes ATP to produce cross-bridge\\naction. Fast fibers hydrolyze ATP approximately twice as quickly as slow fibers, resulting in much quicker cross-\\nbridge cycling (which pulls the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomeres at a faster rate). The primary\\nmetabolic pathway used by a muscle fiber determines whether the fiber is classified as oxidative or glycolytic.

Glycolytic fibers primarily create ATP through anaerobic\\nglycolysis, which produces less ATP per cycle. As a result, glycolytic fibers fatigue at a quicker rate.\\nThe oxidative fibers contain many more mitochondria than the glycolytic fibers, because aerobic metabolism, which\\nuses oxygen (O2) in the metabolic pathway, occurs in the mitochondria. The SO fibers possess a large number of\\nmitochondria and are capable of contracting for longer periods because of the large amount of ATP they can\\nproduce, but they have a relatively small diameter and do not produce a large amount of tension. SO fibers are\\nextensively supplied with blood capillaries to supply O2 from the red blood cells in the bloodstream. The SO fibers\\nalso possess myoglobin, an O2-carrying molecule similar to O2-carrying hemoglobin in the red blood cells. The\\nmyoglobin stores some of the needed O2 within the fibers themselves (and gives SO fibers their red color). All of\\nthese features allow SO fibers to produce large quantities of ATP, which can sustain muscle activity without fatiguing\\nfor long periods of time.\\nThe fact that SO fibers can function for long periods without fatiguing makes them useful in maintaining posture,\\nproducing isometric contractions, stabilizing bones and joints, and making small movements that happen often but\\ndo not require large amounts of energy. They do not produce high tension, and thus they are not used for powerful,\\nfast movements that require high amounts of energy and rapid cross-bridge cycling.\\nFO fibers are sometimes called intermediate fibers because they possess characteristics that are intermediate\\nbetween fast fibers and slow fibers. They produce ATP relatively quickly, more quickly than SO fibers, and thus can\\nproduce relatively high amounts of tension. They are oxidative because they produce ATP aerobically, possess high\\namounts of mitochondria, and do not fatigue quickly. However, FO fibers do not possess significant myoglobin,\\ngiving them a lighter color than the red SO fibers. FO fibers are used primarily for movements, such as walking, that\\nrequire more energy than postural control but less energy than an explosive movement, such as sprinting. FO fibers\\nare useful for this type of movement because they produce more tension than SO fibers but they are more fatigue-\\nresistant than FG fibers.\\nFG fibers primarily use anaerobic glycolysis as their ATP source. They have a large diameter and possess high\\namounts of glycogen, which is used in glycolysis to generate ATP quickly to produce high levels of tension. Because\\nthey do not primarily use aerobic metabolism, they do not possess substantial numbers of mitochondria or\\nsignificant amounts of myoglobin and therefore have a white color. FG fibers are used to produce rapid, forceful\\ncontractions to make quick, powerful movements. These fibers fatigue quickly, permitting them to only be used for\\nshort periods. Most muscles possess a mixture of each fiber type. The predominant fiber type in a muscle is\\ndetermined by the primary function of the muscle.\\n10.6 Exercise and Muscle Performance\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe hypertrophy and atrophy\\n• Explain how resistance exercise builds muscle\\n• Explain how performance-enhancing substances affect muscle\\nPhysical training alters the appearance of skeletal muscles and can produce changes in muscle performance.\\nConversely, a lack of use can result in decreased performance and muscle appearance. Although muscle cells can\\nchange in size, new cells are not formed when muscles grow. Instead, structural proteins are added to muscle fibers\\nin a process called hypertrophy, so cell diameter increases. The reverse, when structural proteins are lost and\\nmuscle mass decreases, is called atrophy. Age-related muscle atrophy is called sarcopenia.

To allow these capillary networks to supply the deep\\nportions of the muscle, muscle mass does not greatly increase in order to maintain a smaller area for the diffusion of\\nnutrients and gases. All of these cellular changes result in the ability to sustain low levels of muscle contractions for\\ngreater periods without fatiguing.\\nThe proportion of SO muscle fibers in muscle determines the suitability of that muscle for endurance, and may\\nbenefit those participating in endurance activities. Postural muscles have a large number of SO fibers and relatively\\nfew FO and FG fibers, to keep the back straight (Figure 10.18). Endurance athletes, like marathon-runners also\\nwould benefit from a larger proportion of SO fibers, but it is unclear if the most-successful marathoners are those\\nwith naturally high numbers of SO fibers, or whether the most successful marathon runners develop high numbers\\nof SO fibers with repetitive training. Endurance training can result in overuse injuries such as stress fractures and\\njoint and tendon inflammation.\\nFIGURE 10.18 Marathoners Long-distance runners have a large number of SO fibers and relatively few FO and FG fibers.

The high rates of ATP hydrolysis and cross-bridge\\nformation in FG fibers result in powerful muscle contractions. Muscles used for power have a higher ratio of FG to\\nSO/FO fibers, and trained athletes possess even higher levels of FG fibers in their muscles. Resistance exercise\\naffects muscles by increasing the formation of myofibrils, thereby increasing the thickness of muscle fibers. This\\nadded structure causes hypertrophy, or the enlargement of muscles, exemplified by the large skeletal muscles seen\\nin body builders and other athletes (Figure 10.19). Because this muscular enlargement is achieved by the addition\\nof structural proteins, athletes trying to build muscle mass often ingest large amounts of protein.\\n10.6 • Exercise and Muscle Performance 379'),\n",

Tendons also become stronger to prevent tendon damage, as the\\nforce produced by muscles is transferred to tendons that attach the muscle to bone.\\nFor effective strength training, the intensity of the exercise must continually be increased. For instance, continued\\nweight lifting without increasing the weight of the load does not increase muscle size. To produce ever-greater\\nresults, the weights lifted must become increasingly heavier, making it more difficult for muscles to move the load.\\nThe muscle then adapts to this heavier load, and an even heavier load must be used if even greater muscle mass is\\ndesired.\\nIf done improperly, resistance training can lead to overuse injuries of the muscle, tendon, or bone. These injuries\\ncan occur if the load is too heavy or if the muscles are not given sufficient time between workouts to recover or if\\njoints are not aligned properly during the exercises. Cellular damage to muscle fibers that occurs after intense\\nexercise includes damage to the sarcolemma and myofibrils.

The extra oxygen carried by these blood cells can then be used by muscles for aerobic\\nrespiration. Human growth hormone (hGH) is another supplement, and although it can facilitate building muscle\\nmass, its main role is to promote the healing of muscle and other tissues after strenuous exercise. Increased hGH\\nmay allow for faster recovery after muscle damage, reducing the rest required after exercise, and allowing for more\\nsustained high-level performance.\\nAlthough performance-enhancing substances often do improve performance, most are banned by governing bodies\\nin sports and are illegal for nonmedical purposes.

This is a primary reason why even highly trained athletes succumb to declining\\nperformance with age. This decline is noticeable in athletes whose sports require strength and powerful\\nmovements, such as sprinting, whereas the effects of age are less noticeable in endurance athletes such as\\nmarathon runners or long-distance cyclists. As muscles age, muscle fibers die, and they are replaced by\\nconnective tissue and adipose tissue (Figure 10.20). Because those tissues cannot contract and generate force\\nas muscle can, muscles lose the ability to produce powerful contractions. The decline in muscle mass causes a\\nloss of strength, including the strength required for posture and mobility. This may be caused by a reduction in\\nFG fibers that hydrolyze ATP quickly to produce short, powerful contractions. Muscles in older people\\nsometimes possess greater numbers of SO fibers, which are responsible for longer contractions and do not\\nproduce powerful movements. There may also be a reduction in the size of motor units, resulting in fewer fibers\\nbeing stimulated and less muscle tension being produced.\\nFIGURE 10.20 Atrophy Muscle mass is reduced as muscles atrophy with disuse.\\nSarcopenia can be delayed to some extent by exercise, as training adds structural proteins and causes cellular\\nchanges that can offset the effects of atrophy. Increased exercise can produce greater numbers of cellular\\nmitochondria, increase capillary density, and increase the mass and strength of connective tissue. The effects of\\nage-related atrophy are especially pronounced in people who are sedentary, as the loss of muscle cells is\\ndisplayed as functional impairments such as trouble with locomotion, balance, and posture. This can lead to a\\ndecrease in quality of life and medical problems, such as joint problems because the muscles that stabilize\\nbones and joints are weakened. Problems with locomotion and balance can also cause various injuries due to\\nfalls.\\n10.7 • Cardiac Muscle Tissue 381'),\n",

The pacemaker cells\\ncan also respond to various hormones that modulate heart rate to control blood pressure.\\nThe wave of contraction that allows the heart to work as a unit, called a functional syncytium, begins with the\\npacemaker cells. This group of cells is self-excitable and able to depolarize to threshold and fire action potentials on\\ntheir own, a feature called autorhythmicity; they do this at set intervals which determine heart rate.

Although they do not have striations and\\nsarcomeres, smooth muscle fibers do have actin and myosin contractile proteins, and thick and thin filaments.\\nThese thin filaments are anchored by dense bodies. A dense body is analogous to the Z-discs of skeletal and cardiac\\nmuscle fibers and is fastened to the sarcolemma. Calcium ions are supplied by the SR in the fibers and by\\nsequestration from the extracellular fluid through membrane indentations called calveoli.\\nBecause smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin, cross-bridge formation is not regulated by the troponin-\\ntropomyosin complex but instead by the regulatory protein calmodulin. In a smooth muscle fiber, external Ca++ ions\\npassing through opened calcium channels in the sarcolemma, and additional Ca++ released from SR, bind to\\ncalmodulin. The Ca++-calmodulin complex then activates an enzyme called myosin (light chain) kinase, which, in\\nturn, activates the myosin heads by phosphorylating them (converting ATP to ADP and Pi, with the Pi attaching to the\\nhead). The heads can then attach to actin-binding sites and pull on the thin filaments. The thin filaments also are\\nanchored to the dense bodies; the structures invested in the inner membrane of the sarcolemma (at adherens\\njunctions) that also have cord-like intermediate filaments attached to them. When the thin filaments slide past the\\nthick filaments, they pull on the dense bodies, structures tethered to the sarcolemma, which then pull on the\\nintermediate filaments networks throughout the sarcoplasm.

T-tubules are not required to reach the interior of the cell and therefore not\\nnecessary to transmit an action potential deep into the fiber. Smooth muscle fibers have a limited calcium-storing\\nSR but have calcium channels in the sarcolemma (similar to cardiac muscle fibers) that open during the action\\npotential along the sarcolemma. The influx of extracellular Ca++ ions, which diffuse into the sarcoplasm to reach the\\ncalmodulin, accounts for most of the Ca++ that triggers contraction of a smooth muscle cell.\\nMuscle contraction continues until ATP-dependent calcium pumps actively transport Ca++ ions back into the SR and\\nout of the cell. However, a low concentration of calcium remains in the sarcoplasm to maintain muscle tone. This\\nremaining calcium keeps the muscle slightly contracted, which is important in certain tracts and around blood\\nvessels.\\nBecause most smooth muscles must function for long periods without rest, their power output is relatively low, but\\ncontractions can continue without using large amounts of energy. Some smooth muscle can also maintain\\ncontractions even as Ca++ is removed and myosin kinase is inactivated/dephosphorylated. This can happen as a\\nsubset of cross-bridges between myosin heads and actin, called latch-bridges, keep the thick and thin filaments\\nlinked together for a prolonged period, and without the need for ATP. This allows for the maintaining of muscle\\n“tone” in smooth muscle that lines arterioles and other visceral organs with very little energy expenditure.\\nSmooth muscle is not under voluntary control; thus, it is called involuntary muscle. The triggers for smooth muscle\\ncontraction include hormones, neural stimulation by the ANS, and local factors. In certain locations, such as the\\nwalls of visceral organs, stretching the muscle can trigger its contraction (the stress-relaxation response).\\nAxons of neurons in the ANS do not form the highly organized NMJs with smooth muscle, as seen between motor\\nneurons and skeletal muscle fibers. Instead, there is a series of neurotransmitter-filled bulges called varicosities as\\nan axon courses through smooth muscle, loosely forming motor units (Figure 10.25). A varicosity releases\\nneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Also, visceral muscle in the walls of the hollow organs (except the heart)\\ncontains pacesetter cells.

The two types have different locations in the body and have different characteristics.\\nSingle-unit muscle has its muscle fibers joined by gap junctions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit. This\\ntype of smooth muscle is found in the walls of all visceral organs except the heart (which has cardiac muscle in its\\nwalls), and so it is commonly called visceral muscle. Because the muscle fibers are not constrained by the\\norganization and stretchability limits of sarcomeres, visceral smooth muscle has a stress-relaxation response. This\\nmeans that as the muscle of a hollow organ is stretched when it fills, the mechanical stress of the stretching will\\ntrigger contraction, but this is immediately followed by relaxation so that the organ does not empty its contents\\nprematurely. This is important for hollow organs, such as the stomach or urinary bladder, which continuously expand\\nas they fill. The smooth muscle around these organs also can maintain a muscle tone when the organ empties and\\nshrinks, a feature that prevents “flabbiness” in the empty organ. In general, visceral smooth muscle produces slow,\\nsteady contractions that allow substances, such as food in the digestive tract, to move through the body.\\nMultiunit smooth muscle cells rarely possess gap junctions, and thus are not electrically coupled. As a result,\\ncontraction does not spread from one cell to the next, but is instead confined to the cell that was originally\\nstimulated. Stimuli for multiunit smooth muscles come from autonomic nerves or hormones but not from stretching.\\nThis type of tissue is found around large blood vessels, in the respiratory airways, and in the eyes.\\nHyperplasia in Smooth Muscle\\nSimilar to skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, smooth muscle can undergo hypertrophy to increase in size. Unlike\\nother muscle, smooth muscle can also divide to produce more cells, a process called hyperplasia. This can most\\nevidently be observed in the uterus at puberty, which responds to increased estrogen levels by producing more\\nuterine smooth muscle fibers, and greatly increases the size of the myometrium.\\n10.9 Development and Regeneration of Muscle Tissue\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the function of satellite cells\\n• Define fibrosis\\n• Explain which muscle has the greatest regeneration ability\\nMost muscle tissue of the body arises from embryonic mesoderm. Paraxial mesodermal cells adjacent to the neural\\ntube form blocks of cells called somites. Skeletal muscles, excluding those of the head and limbs, develop from\\nmesodermal somites, whereas skeletal muscle in the head and limbs develop from general mesoderm. Somites give\\nrise to myoblasts. A myoblast is a muscle-forming stem cell that migrates to different regions in the body and then\\nfuse(s) to form a syncytium, or myotube. As a myotube is formed from many different myoblast cells, it contains\\nmany nuclei, but has a continuous cytoplasm. This is why skeletal muscle cells are multinucleate, as the nucleus of\\neach contributing myoblast remains intact in the mature skeletal muscle cell. However, cardiac and smooth muscle\\ncells are not multinucleate because the myoblasts that form their cells do not fuse.\\nGap junctions develop in the cardiac and single-unit smooth muscle in the early stages of development. In skeletal\\nmuscles, ACh receptors are initially present along most of the surface of the myoblasts, but spinal nerve innervation\\ncauses the release of growth factors that stimulate the formation of motor end-plates and NMJs. As neurons\\nbecome active, electrical signals that are sent through the muscle influence the distribution of slow and fast fibers in\\nthe muscle.\\nAlthough the number of muscle cells is set during development, satellite cells help to repair skeletal muscle cells. A\\nsatellite cell is similar to a myoblast because it is a type of stem cell; however, satellite cells are incorporated into\\nmuscle cells and facilitate the protein synthesis required for repair and growth. These cells are located outside the\\nsarcolemma and are stimulated to grow and fuse with muscle cells by growth factors that are released by muscle\\nfibers under certain forms of stress. Satellite cells can regenerate muscle fibers to a very limited extent, but they\\nprimarily help to repair damage in living cells. If a cell is damaged to a greater extent than can be repaired by\\nsatellite cells, the muscle fibers are replaced by scar tissue in a process called fibrosis. Because scar tissue cannot\\ncontract, muscle that has sustained significant damage loses strength and cannot produce the same amount of\\npower or endurance as it could before being damaged.\\n386 10 • Muscle Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

They are trained to target muscles susceptible to atrophy,\\nand to prescribe and monitor exercises designed to stimulate those muscles. There are various causes of atrophy,\\nincluding mechanical injury, disease, and age. After breaking a limb or undergoing surgery, muscle use is impaired\\nand can lead to disuse atrophy. If the muscles are not exercised, this atrophy can lead to long-term muscle\\nweakness.

Myofibrils are composed of thick and thin\\nfilaments. Thick filaments are composed of the protein\\nmyosin; thin filaments are composed of the protein\\nactin. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory\\nproteins.\\nMuscle contraction is described by the sliding filament\\nmodel of contraction. ACh is the neurotransmitter that\\nbinds at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to trigger\\ndepolarization, and an action potential travels along\\nthe sarcolemma to trigger calcium release from SR.\\nThe actin sites are exposed after Ca++ enters the\\nsarcoplasm from its SR storage to activate the\\ntroponin-tropomyosin complex so that the tropomyosin\\nshifts away from the sites. The cross-bridging of\\nmyosin heads docking into actin-binding sites is\\nfollowed by the “power stroke”—the sliding of the thin\\nfilaments by thick filaments. The power strokes are\\npowered by ATP. Ultimately, the sarcomeres,\\nmyofibrils, and muscle fibers shorten to produce\\nmovement.\\n10.4 Nervous System Control of Muscle\\nTension\\nThe number of cross-bridges formed between actin\\nand myosin determines the amount of tension\\nproduced by a muscle. The length of a sarcomere is\\noptimal when the zone of overlap between thin and\\nthick filaments is greatest. Muscles that are stretched\\nor compressed too greatly do not produce maximal\\namounts of power. A motor unit is formed by a motor\\nneuron and all of the muscle fibers that are innervated\\nby that same motor neuron. A single contraction is\\ncalled a twitch. A muscle twitch has a latent period, a\\ncontraction phase, and a relaxation phase. A graded\\nmuscle response allows variation in muscle tension.\\nSummation occurs as successive stimuli are added\\ntogether to produce a stronger muscle contraction.\\nTetanus is the fusion of contractions to produce a\\ncontinuous contraction. Increasing the number of\\nmotor neurons involved increases the amount of motor\\nunits activated in a muscle, which is called recruitment.\\nMuscle tone is the constant low-level contractions that\\nallow for posture and stability.\\n10.5 Types of Muscle Fibers\\nATP provides the energy for muscle contraction. The\\nthree mechanisms for ATP regeneration are creatine\\nphosphate, anaerobic glycolysis, and aerobic\\nmetabolism. Creatine phosphate provides about the\\nfirst 15 seconds of ATP at the beginning of muscle\\ncontraction. Anaerobic glycolysis produces small\\namounts of ATP in the absence of oxygen for a short\\nperiod. Aerobic metabolism utilizes oxygen to produce\\nmuch more ATP, allowing a muscle to work for longer\\nperiods. Muscle fatigue, which has many contributing\\nfactors, occurs when muscle can no longer contract. An\\noxygen debt is created as a result of muscle use. The\\nthree types of muscle fiber are slow oxidative (SO), fast\\noxidative (FO) and fast glycolytic (FG). SO fibers use\\naerobic metabolism to produce low power contractions\\nover long periods and are slow to fatigue. FO fibers use\\naerobic metabolism to produce ATP but produce higher\\ntension contractions than SO fibers.

The opposite of\\nhypertrophy is atrophy, the loss of muscle mass due to\\nthe breakdown of structural proteins. Endurance\\nexercise causes an increase in cellular mitochondria,\\nmyoglobin, and capillary networks in SO fibers.\\nEndurance athletes have a high level of SO fibers\\nrelative to the other fiber types. Resistance exercise\\ncauses hypertrophy. Power-producing muscles have a\\nhigher number of FG fibers than of slow fibers.\\nStrenuous exercise causes muscle cell damage that\\nrequires time to heal. Some athletes use performance-\\nenhancing substances to enhance muscle\\nperformance. Muscle atrophy due to age is called\\nsarcopenia and occurs as muscle fibers die and are\\nreplaced by connective and adipose tissue.\\n10.7 Cardiac Muscle Tissue\\nCardiac muscle is striated muscle that is present only\\nin the heart.

Pacemaker\\ncells stimulate the spontaneous contraction of cardiac\\nmuscle as a functional unit, called a syncytium.\\n10.8 Smooth Muscle\\nSmooth muscle is found throughout the body around\\nvarious organs and tracts. Smooth muscle cells have a\\nsingle nucleus, and are spindle-shaped. Smooth\\nmuscle cells can undergo hyperplasia, mitotically\\ndividing to produce new cells. The smooth cells are\\nnonstriated, but their sarcoplasm is filled with actin\\nand myosin, along with dense bodies in the\\nsarcolemma to anchor the thin filaments and a network\\nof intermediate filaments involved in pulling the\\nsarcolemma toward the fiber’s middle, shortening it in\\nthe process. Ca++ ions trigger contraction when they\\nare released from SR and enter through opened\\nvoltage-gated calcium channels. Smooth muscle\\ncontraction is initiated when the Ca++ binds to\\nintracellular calmodulin, which then activates an\\nenzyme called myosin kinase that phosphorylates\\nmyosin heads so they can form the cross-bridges with\\nactin and then pull on the thin filaments. Smooth\\nmuscle can be stimulated by pacesetter cells, by the\\nautonomic nervous system, by hormones,\\nspontaneously, or by stretching. The fibers in some\\nsmooth muscle have latch-bridges, cross-bridges that\\ncycle slowly without the need for ATP; these muscles\\ncan maintain low-level contractions for long periods.\\nSingle-unit smooth muscle tissue contains gap\\njunctions to synchronize membrane depolarization and\\ncontractions so that the muscle contracts as a single\\nunit. Single-unit smooth muscle in the walls of the\\nviscera, called visceral muscle, has a stress-relaxation\\nresponse that permits muscle to stretch, contract, and\\nrelax as the organ expands. Multiunit smooth muscle\\ncells do not possess gap junctions, and contraction\\ndoes not spread from one cell to the next.\\n10.9 Development and Regeneration of\\nMuscle Tissue\\nMuscle tissue arises from embryonic mesoderm.\\nSomites give rise to myoblasts and fuse to form a\\nmyotube. The nucleus of each contributing myoblast\\nremains intact in the mature skeletal muscle cell,\\nresulting in a mature, multinucleate cell. Satellite cells\\nhelp to repair skeletal muscle cells. Smooth muscle\\ntissue can regenerate from stem cells called pericytes,\\nwhereas dead cardiac muscle tissue is replaced by scar\\ntissue. Aging causes muscle mass to decrease and be\\nreplaced by noncontractile connective tissue and\\nadipose tissue.\\nInteractive Link Questions\\n1.

Skeletal muscles are even used during sleep. The\\ndiaphragm is a sheet of skeletal muscle that has to contract and relax for you to breathe day and night. If you recall\\nfrom your study of the skeletal system and joints, body movement occurs around the joints in the body. The focus of\\nthis chapter is on skeletal muscle organization. The system to name skeletal muscles will be explained; in some\\ncases, the muscle is named by its shape, and in other cases it is named by its location or attachments to the\\nskeleton. If you understand the meaning of the name of the muscle, often it will help you remember its location and/\\nor what it does. This chapter also will describe how skeletal muscles are arranged to accomplish movement, and\\nhow other muscles may assist, or be arranged on the skeleton to resist or carry out the opposite movement.

The tendons are strong bands of dense, regular connective tissue that connect muscles to bones. The\\nbone connection is why this muscle tissue is called skeletal muscle.\\nInteractions of Skeletal Muscles in the Body\\nTo pull on a bone, that is, to change the angle at its synovial joint, which essentially moves the skeleton, a skeletal\\nmuscle must also be attached to a fixed part of the skeleton. The moveable end of the muscle that attaches to the\\nbone being pulled is called the muscle’s insertion, and the end of the muscle attached to a fixed (stabilized) bone is\\ncalled the origin. During forearm flexion—bending the elbow—the brachioradialis assists the brachialis.\\nAlthough a number of muscles may be involved in an action, the principal muscle involved is called the prime\\nmover, or agonist. To lift a cup, a muscle called the biceps brachii is actually the prime mover; however, because it\\ncan be assisted by the brachialis, the brachialis is called a synergist in this action (Figure 11.2). A synergist can also\\nbe a fixator that stabilizes the bone that is the attachment for the prime mover’s origin.\\nFIGURE 11.2 Prime Movers and Synergists The biceps brachii flex the lower arm. The brachoradialis, in the forearm, and brachialis,\\nlocated deep to the biceps in the upper arm, are both synergists that aid in this motion.\\nA muscle with the opposite action of the prime mover is called an antagonist. Antagonists play two important roles\\nin muscle function: (1) they maintain body or limb position, such as holding the arm out or standing erect; and (2)\\nthey control rapid movement, as in shadow boxing without landing a punch or the ability to check the motion of a\\nlimb.\\nFor example, to extend the knee, a group of four muscles called the quadriceps femoris in the anterior compartment\\nof the thigh are activated (and would be called the agonists of knee extension). However, to flex the knee joint, an\\nopposite or antagonistic set of muscles called the hamstrings is activated.\\nAs you can see, these terms would also be reversed for the opposing action. If you consider the first action as the\\nknee bending, the hamstrings would be called the agonists and the quadriceps femoris would then be called the\\nantagonists. See Table 11.1 for a list of some agonists and antagonists.\\n396 11 • The Muscular System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

For example, there are the\\nmuscles that produce facial expressions. The insertions and origins of facial muscles are in the skin, so that certain\\nindividual muscles contract to form a smile or frown, form sounds or words, and raise the eyebrows. There also are\\nskeletal muscles in the tongue, and the external urinary and anal sphincters that allow for voluntary regulation of\\nurination and defecation, respectively. In addition, the diaphragm contracts and relaxes to change the volume of the\\npleural cavities but it does not move the skeleton to do this.\\nPatterns of Fascicle Organization\\nSkeletal muscle is enclosed in connective tissue scaffolding at three levels. Each muscle fiber (cell) is covered by\\nendomysium and the entire muscle is covered by epimysium. When a group of muscle fibers is “bundled” as a unit\\nwithin the whole muscle by an additional covering of a connective tissue called perimysium, that bundled group of\\nmuscle fibers is called a fascicle. Fascicle arrangement by perimysia is correlated to the force generated by a\\nmuscle; it also affects the range of motion of the muscle. Based on the patterns of fascicle arrangement, skeletal\\nmuscles can be classified in several ways. What follows are the most common fascicle arrangements.\\nEveryday Connection\\nExercise and Stretching\\nWhen exercising, it is important to first warm up the muscles. Stretching pulls on the muscle fibers and it also\\nresults in an increased blood flow to the muscles being worked. Without a proper warm-up, it is possible that\\nyou may either damage some of the muscle fibers or pull a tendon. A pulled tendon, regardless of location,\\nresults in pain, swelling, and diminished function; if it is moderate to severe, the injury could immobilize you for\\nan extended period.\\nRecall the discussion about muscles crossing joints to create movement. Most of the joints you use during\\nexercise are synovial joints, which have synovial fluid in the joint space between two bones. Exercise and\\nstretching may also have a beneficial effect on synovial joints. Synovial fluid is a thin, but viscous film with the\\nconsistency of egg whites. When you first get up and start moving, your joints feel stiff for a number of reasons.\\nAfter proper stretching and warm-up, the synovial fluid may become less viscous, allowing for better joint\\nfunction.\\n11.1 • Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems 397'),\n",

Some parallel muscles are flat sheets\\nthat expand at the ends to make broad attachments. Other parallel muscles are rotund with tendons at one or both\\nends. Muscles that seem to be plump have a large mass of tissue located in the middle of the muscle, between the\\ninsertion and the origin, which is known as the central body. A more common name for this muscle is belly. When a\\nmuscle contracts, the contractile fibers shorten it to an even larger bulge. For example, extend and then flex your\\nbiceps brachii muscle; the large, middle section is the belly (Figure 11.4). When a parallel muscle has a central,\\nlarge belly that is spindle-shaped, meaning it tapers as it extends to its origin and insertion, it sometimes is called\\nfusiform.\\nFIGURE 11.3 Muscle Shapes and Fiber Alignment The skeletal muscles of the body typically come in seven different general shapes.\\n398 11 • The Muscular System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Tendons emerge from\\nboth ends of the belly and connect the muscle to the bones, allowing the skeleton to move. The tendons of the bicep connect to the upper\\narm and the forearm. (credit: Victoria Garcia)\\nCircular muscles are also called sphincters (see Figure 11.3). When they relax, the sphincters’ concentrically\\narranged bundles of muscle fibers increase the size of the opening, and when they contract, the size of the opening\\nshrinks to the point of closure. The orbicularis oris muscle is a circular muscle that goes around the mouth. When it\\ncontracts, the oral opening becomes smaller, as when puckering the lips for whistling. Another example is the\\norbicularis oculi, one of which surrounds each eye. Consider, for example, the names of the two orbicularis muscles\\n(orbicularis oris and oribicularis oculi), where part of the first name of both muscles is the same. The first part of\\norbicularis, orb (orb = “circular”), is a reference to a round or circular structure; it may also make one think of orbit,\\nsuch as the moon’s path around the earth. The word oris (oris = “oral”) refers to the oral cavity, or the mouth. The\\nword oculi (ocular = “eye”) refers to the eye.\\nThere are other muscles throughout the body named by their shape or location. The deltoid is a large, triangular-\\nshaped muscle that covers the shoulder. It is so-named because the Greek letter delta looks like a triangle. The\\nrectus abdominis (rector = “straight”) is the straight muscle in the anterior wall of the abdomen, while the rectus\\nfemoris is the straight muscle in the anterior compartment of the thigh.\\nWhen a muscle has a widespread expansion over a sizable area, but then the fascicles come to a single, common\\nattachment point, the muscle is called convergent. The attachment point for a convergent muscle could be a\\ntendon, an aponeurosis (a flat, broad tendon), or a raphe (a very slender tendon). The large muscle on the chest, the\\npectoralis major, is an example of a convergent muscle because it converges on the greater tubercle of the humerus\\nvia a tendon. The temporalis muscle of the cranium is another.\\nPennate muscles (penna = “feathers”) blend into a tendon that runs through the central region of the muscle for its\\nwhole length, somewhat like the quill of a feather with the muscle arranged similar to the feathers. Due to this\\ndesign, the muscle fibers in a pennate muscle can only pull at an angle, and as a result, contracting pennate muscles\\ndo not move their tendons very far. However, because a pennate muscle generally can hold more muscle fibers\\nwithin it, it can produce relatively more tension for its size. There are three subtypes of pennate muscles.\\nIn a unipennate muscle, the fascicles are located on one side of the tendon. The extensor digitorum of the forearm\\nis an example of a unipennate muscle. A bipennate muscle has fascicles on both sides of the tendon. In some\\npennate muscles, the muscle fibers wrap around the tendon, sometimes forming individual fascicles in the process.\\nThis arrangement is referred to as multipennate. A common example is the deltoid muscle of the shoulder, which\\ncovers the shoulder but has a single tendon that inserts on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.\\n11.1 • Interactions of Skeletal Muscles, Their Fascicle Arrangement, and Their Lever Systems 399'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 415}, page_content='Because of fascicles, a portion of a multipennate muscle like the deltoid can be stimulated by the nervous system to\\nchange the direction of the pull. For example, when the deltoid muscle contracts, the arm abducts (moves away\\nfrom midline in the sagittal plane), but when only the anterior fascicle is stimulated, the arm will abduct and flex\\n(move anteriorly at the shoulder joint).\\nThe Lever System of Muscle and Bone Interactions\\nSkeletal muscles do not work by themselves. Muscles are arranged in pairs based on their functions. For muscles\\nattached to the bones of the skeleton, the connection determines the force, speed, and range of movement. These\\ncharacteristics depend on each other and can explain the general organization of the muscular and skeletal\\nsystems.\\nThe skeleton and muscles act together to move the body. Have you ever used the back of a hammer to remove a nail\\nfrom wood? The handle acts as a lever and the head of the hammer acts as a fulcrum, the fixed point that the force\\nis applied to when you pull back or push down on the handle. The effort applied to this system is the pulling or\\npushing on the handle to remove the nail, which is the load, or “resistance” to the movement of the handle in the\\nsystem. Our musculoskeletal system works in a similar manner, with bones being stiff levers and the articular\\nendings of the bones—encased in synovial joints—acting as fulcrums. The load would be an object being lifted or any\\nresistance to a movement (your head is a load when you are lifting it), and the effort, or applied force, comes from\\ncontracting skeletal muscle.\\n11.2 Naming Skeletal Muscles\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the criteria used to name skeletal muscles\\n• Explain how understanding the muscle names helps describe shapes, location, and actions of various muscles\\nThe Greeks and Romans conducted the first studies done on the human body in Western culture. The educated\\nclass of subsequent societies studied Latin and Greek, and therefore the early pioneers of anatomy continued to\\napply Latin and Greek terminology or roots when they named the skeletal muscles. The large number of muscles in\\nthe body and unfamiliar words can make learning the names of the muscles in the body seem daunting, but\\nunderstanding the etymology can help. Etymology is the study of how the root of a particular word entered a\\nlanguage and how the use of the word evolved over time. Taking the time to learn the root of the words is crucial to\\nunderstanding the vocabulary of anatomy and physiology. When you understand the names of muscles it will help\\nyou remember where the muscles are located and what they do (Figure 11.5, Figure 11.6, and Table 11.2).\\nPronunciation of words and terms will take a bit of time to master, but after you have some basic information; the\\ncorrect names and pronunciations will become easier.\\n400 11 • The Muscular System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These include naming the muscle after its shape, its size compared to other muscles in the area, its\\nlocation in the body or the location of its attachments to the skeleton, how many origins it has, or its action.\\nThe skeletal muscle’s anatomical location or its relationship to a particular bone often determines its name. For\\nexample, the frontalis muscle is located on top of the frontal bone of the skull. Similarly, the shapes of some\\nmuscles are very distinctive and the names, such as orbicularis, reflect the shape. For the buttocks, the size of the\\nmuscles influences the names: gluteus maximus (largest), gluteus medius (medium), and the gluteus minimus\\n(smallest). Names were given to indicate length—brevis (short), longus (long)—and to identify position relative to\\nthe midline: lateralis (to the outside away from the midline), and medialis (toward the midline). The direction of the\\nmuscle fibers and fascicles are used to describe muscles relative to the midline, such as the rectus (straight)\\nabdominis, or the oblique (at an angle) muscles of the abdomen.\\nSome muscle names indicate the number of muscles in a group. One example of this is the quadriceps, a group of\\nfour muscles located on the anterior (front) thigh. Other muscle names can provide information as to how many\\norigins a particular muscle has, such as the biceps brachii. The prefix bi indicates that the muscle has two origins\\nand tri indicates three origins.\\nThe location of a muscle’s attachment can also appear in its name. When the name of a muscle is based on the\\nattachments, the origin is always named first. For instance, the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck has a dual\\norigin on the sternum (sterno) and clavicle (cleido), and it inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The\\nlast feature by which to name a muscle is its action. When muscles are named for the movement they produce, one\\ncan find action words in their name. Some examples are flexor (decreases the angle at the joint), extensor\\n(increases the angle at the joint), abductor (moves the bone away from the midline), or adductor (moves the bone\\ntoward the midline).\\n11.3 Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the axial muscles of the face, head, and neck\\n• Identify the movement and function of the face, head, and neck muscles\\nThe skeletal muscles are divided into axial (muscles of the trunk and head) and appendicular (muscles of the arms\\nand legs) categories. This system reflects the bones of the skeleton system, which are also arranged in this manner.\\nThe axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur the\\nboundaries because they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The first grouping of the axial muscles you will\\nreview includes the muscles of the head and neck, then you will review the muscles of the vertebral column, and\\nfinally you will review the oblique and rectus muscles.\\nMuscles That Create Facial Expression\\nThe origins of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does\\n11.3 • Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and Back 403'),\n",

The insertions of these muscles have fibers intertwined with connective tissue and the dermis of the\\nskin. Because the muscles insert in the skin rather than on bone, when they contract, the skin moves to create facial\\nexpression (Figure 11.7).\\nFIGURE 11.7 Muscles of Facial Expression Many of the muscles of facial expression insert into the skin surrounding the eyelids, nose\\nand mouth, producing facial expressions by moving the skin rather than bones.\\nThe orbicularis oris is a circular muscle that moves the lips, and the orbicularis oculi is a circular muscle that\\ncloses the eye. The occipitofrontalis muscle moves up the scalp and eyebrows. The muscle has a frontal belly and\\nan occipital (near the occipital bone on the posterior part of the skull) belly. In other words, there is a muscle on the\\nforehead (frontalis) and one on the back of the head (occipitalis), but there is no muscle across the top of the head.\\nInstead, the two bellies are connected by a broad tendon called the epicranial aponeurosis, or galea aponeurosis\\n(galea = “helmet”). The physicians originally studying human anatomy thought the skull looked like a helmet.\\nA large portion of the face is composed of the buccinator muscle, which compresses the cheek. This muscle allows\\nyou to whistle, blow, and suck; and it contributes to the action of chewing. There are several small facial muscles,\\none of which is the corrugator supercilii, which is the prime mover of the eyebrows. Place your finger on your\\neyebrows at the point of the bridge of the nose. Raise your eyebrows as if you were surprised and lower your\\neyebrows as if you were frowning.

The muscles of the neck are categorized according to their position relative to the hyoid bone\\n(Figure 11.13). Suprahyoid muscles are superior to it, and the infrahyoid muscles are located inferiorly.\\nFIGURE 11.13 Muscles of the Anterior Neck The anterior muscles of the neck facilitate swallowing and speech. The suprahyoid\\nmuscles originate from above the hyoid bone in the chin region. The infrahyoid muscles originate below the hyoid bone in the lower neck.\\nThe suprahyoid muscles raise the hyoid bone, the floor of the mouth, and the larynx during deglutition. These\\ninclude the digastric muscle, which has anterior and posterior bellies that work to elevate the hyoid bone and larynx\\nwhen one swallows; it also depresses the mandible. The stylohyoid muscle moves the hyoid bone posteriorly,\\nelevating the larynx, and the mylohyoid muscle lifts it and helps press the tongue to the top of the mouth. The\\ngeniohyoid depresses the mandible in addition to raising and pulling the hyoid bone anteriorly.\\nEveryday Connection\\nAnesthesia and the Tongue Muscles\\nBefore surgery, a patient must be made ready for general anesthesia. The normal homeostatic controls of the\\nbody are put “on hold” so that the patient can be prepped for surgery. Control of respiration must be switched\\nfrom the patient’s homeostatic control to the control of the anesthesiologist. The drugs used for anesthesia relax\\na majority of the body’s muscles.\\nAmong the muscles affected during general anesthesia are those that are necessary for breathing and moving\\nthe tongue. Under anesthesia, the tongue can relax and partially or fully block the airway, and the muscles of\\nrespiration may not move the diaphragm or chest wall. To avoid possible complications, the safest procedure to\\nuse on a patient is called endotracheal intubation. Placing a tube into the trachea allows the doctors to maintain\\na patient’s (open) airway to the lungs and seal the airway off from the oropharynx. Post-surgery, the\\nanesthesiologist gradually changes the mixture of the gases that keep the patient unconscious, and when the\\nmuscles of respiration begin to function, the tube is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a patient to\\nwake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of respiration.

You will be instructed to do a series of exercises to continue\\nthe therapy at home, followed by icing, to decrease inflammation and swelling, which will continue for several\\nweeks. When physical therapy is complete, the PT will do an exit exam and send a detailed report on the improved\\nrange of motion and return of normal limb function to your doctor. Gradually, as the injury heals, the shoulder will\\nbegin to function correctly.

Comparatively, there is much more movement at the pectoral girdle than at the pelvic girdle.\\nThere is very little movement of the pelvic girdle because of its connection with the sacrum at the base of the axial\\nskeleton. The pelvic girdle is less range of motion because it was designed to stabilize and support the body.\\nMuscles of the Thigh\\nWhat would happen if the pelvic girdle, which attaches the lower limbs to the torso, were capable of the same range\\nof motion as the pectoral girdle? For one thing, walking would expend more energy if the heads of the femurs were\\nnot secured in the acetabula of the pelvis. The body’s center of gravity is in the area of the pelvis. If the center of\\ngravity were not to remain fixed, standing up would be difficult as well. Therefore, what the leg muscles lack in range\\nof motion and versatility, they make up for in size and power, facilitating the body’s stabilization, posture, and\\nmovement.\\nGluteal Region Muscles That Move the Femur\\nMost muscles that insert on the femur (the thigh bone) and move it, originate on the pelvic girdle.

The superficial muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg all insert onto the\\ncalcaneal tendon (Achilles tendon), a strong tendon that inserts into the calcaneal bone of the ankle. The muscles\\nin this compartment are large and strong and keep humans upright. The most superficial and visible muscle of the\\ncalf is the gastrocnemius. Deep to the gastrocnemius is the wide, flat soleus. The plantaris runs obliquely between\\nthe two; some people may have two of these muscles, whereas no plantaris is observed in about seven percent of\\nother cadaver dissections. The plantaris tendon is a desirable substitute for the fascia lata in hernia repair, tendon\\ntransplants, and repair of ligaments. There are four deep muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg as well:\\nthe popliteus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, and tibialis posterior.\\nThe foot also has intrinsic muscles, which originate and insert within it (similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand).\\nThese muscles primarily provide support for the foot and its arch, and contribute to movements of the toes (Figure\\n11.34 and Figure 11.35). The principal support for the longitudinal arch of the foot is a deep fascia called plantar\\naponeurosis, which runs from the calcaneus bone to the toes (inflammation of this tissue is the cause of “plantar\\nfasciitis,” which can affect runners. The intrinsic muscles of the foot consist of two groups. The dorsal group\\nincludes only one muscle, the extensor digitorum brevis. The second group is the plantar group, which consists of\\nfour layers, starting with the most superficial.\\nFIGURE 11.34 Intrinsic Muscles of the Foot The muscles along the dorsal side of the foot (a) generally extend the toes while the\\nmuscles of the plantar side of the foot (b, c, d) generally flex the toes. The plantar muscles exist in three layers, providing the foot the\\nstrength to counterbalance the weight of the body. In this diagram, these three layers are shown from a plantar view beginning with the\\nbottom-most layer just under the plantar skin of the foot (b) and ending with the top-most layer (d) located just inferior to the foot and toe\\nbones.\\n11.6 • Appendicular Muscles of the Pelvic Girdle and Lower Limbs 439'),\n",

Meanwhile, a muscle with the opposite\\naction of the prime mover is called an antagonist.\\nSeveral factors contribute to the force generated by a\\nskeletal muscle. One is the arrangement of the\\nfascicles in the skeletal muscle. Fascicles can be\\nparallel, circular, convergent, pennate, fusiform, or\\ntriangular. Each arrangement has its own range of\\nmotion and ability to do work.\\n11.2 Naming Skeletal Muscles\\nMuscle names are based on many characteristics. The\\nlocation of a muscle in the body is important. Some\\nmuscles are named based on their size and location,\\nsuch as the gluteal muscles of the buttocks. Other\\nmuscle names can indicate the location in the body or\\nbones with which the muscle is associated, such as the\\ntibialis anterior. The shapes of some muscles are\\ndistinctive; for example, the direction of the muscle\\nfibers is used to describe muscles of the body midline.\\nThe origin and/or insertion can also be features used to\\nname a muscle; examples are the biceps brachii,\\ntriceps brachii, and the pectoralis major.\\n11.3 Axial Muscles of the Head, Neck, and\\nBack\\nMuscles are either axial muscles or appendicular. The\\naxial muscles are grouped based on location, function,\\nor both. Some axial muscles cross over to the\\nappendicular skeleton. The muscles of the head and\\nneck are all axial. The muscles in the face create facial\\nexpression by inserting into the skin rather than onto\\nbone. Muscles that move the eyeballs are extrinsic,\\nmeaning they originate outside of the eye and insert\\nonto it. Tongue muscles are both extrinsic and intrinsic.\\nThe genioglossus depresses the tongue and moves it\\nanteriorly; the styloglossus lifts the tongue and retracts\\nit; the palatoglossus elevates the back of the tongue;\\nand the hyoglossus depresses and flattens it. The\\nmuscles of the anterior neck facilitate swallowing and\\nspeech, stabilize the hyoid bone and position the\\nlarynx. The muscles of the neck stabilize and move the\\nhead. The sternocleidomastoid divides the neck into\\nanterior and posterior triangles.\\nThe muscles of the back and neck that move the\\nvertebral column are complex, overlapping, and can be\\ndivided into five groups. The splenius group includes\\nthe splenius capitis and the splenius cervicis. The\\nerector spinae has three subgroups. The iliocostalis\\ngroup includes the iliocostalis cervicis, the iliocostalis\\nthoracis, and the iliocostalis lumborum. The\\nlongissimus group includes the longissimus capitis, the\\nlongissimus cervicis, and the longissimus thoracis. The\\nspinalis group includes the spinalis capitis, the spinalis\\ncervicis, and the spinalis thoracis. The\\ntransversospinales include the semispinalis capitis,\\nsemispinalis cervicis, semispinalis thoracis, multifidus,\\nand rotatores. The segmental muscles include the\\ninterspinales and intertransversarii. Finally, the\\nscalenes include the anterior scalene, middle scalene,\\nand posterior scalene.\\n11.4 Axial Muscles of the Abdominal Wall,\\nand Thorax\\nMade of skin, fascia, and four pairs of muscle, the\\nanterior abdominal wall protects the organs located in\\nthe abdomen and moves the vertebral column. These\\nmuscles include the rectus abdominis, which extends\\nthrough the entire length of the trunk, the external\\noblique, the internal oblique, and the transversus\\nabdominis. The quadratus lumborum forms the\\nposterior abdominal wall.\\nThe muscles of the thorax play a large role in breathing,\\nespecially the dome-shaped diaphragm. When it\\ncontracts and flattens, the volume inside the pleural\\ncavities increases, which decreases the pressure within\\nthem. As a result, air will flow into the lungs. The\\nexternal and internal intercostal muscles span the\\nspace between the ribs and help change the shape of\\nthe rib cage and the volume-pressure ratio inside the\\npleural cavities during inspiration and expiration.\\nThe perineum muscles play roles in urination in both\\nsexes, ejaculation in males, and vaginal contraction in\\nfemales. The pelvic floor muscles support the pelvic\\norgans, resist intra-abdominal pressure, and work as\\nsphincters for the urethra, rectum, and vagina.\\n11.5 Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle and\\nUpper Limbs\\nThe clavicle and scapula make up the pectoral girdle,\\nwhich provides a stable origin for the muscles that\\nmove the humerus. The muscles that position and\\nstabilize the pectoral girdle are located on the thorax.\\nThe anterior thoracic muscles are the subclavius,\\npectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior. The\\nposterior thoracic muscles are the trapezius, levator\\nscapulae, rhomboid major, and rhomboid minor. Nine\\nmuscles cross the shoulder joint to move the humerus.\\nThe ones that originate on the axial skeleton are the\\npectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. The deltoid,\\nsubscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres\\nmajor, teres minor, and coracobrachialis originate on\\nthe scapula.\\nThe forearm flexors include the biceps brachii,\\nbrachialis, and brachioradialis.

The pronators are the\\npronator teres and the pronator quadratus. The\\nsupinator is the only one that turns the forearm\\nanteriorly.\\nThe extrinsic muscles of the hands originate along the\\nforearm and insert into the hand in order to facilitate\\ncrude movements of the wrists, hands, and fingers. The\\nsuperficial anterior compartment of the forearm\\nproduces flexion. These muscles are the flexor carpi\\nradialis, palmaris longus, flexor carpi ulnaris, and the\\nflexor digitorum superficialis. The deep anterior\\ncompartment produces flexion as well. These are the\\nflexor pollicis longus and the flexor digitorum\\nprofundus. The rest of the compartments produce\\nextension. The extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor\\ncarpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti\\nminimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris are the muscles\\nfound in the superficial posterior compartment. The\\ndeep posterior compartment includes the abductor\\nlongus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis\\nlongus, and the extensor indicis.\\nFinally, the intrinsic muscles of the hands allow our\\nfingers to make precise movements, such as typing and\\nwriting.

The intermediate muscles, located in the\\nmiddle of the palm, are the lumbricals, palmar\\ninterossei, and dorsal interossei.\\n11.6 Appendicular Muscles of the Pelvic\\nGirdle and Lower Limbs\\nThe pelvic girdle attaches the legs to the axial skeleton.\\nThe hip joint is where the pelvic girdle and the leg\\ncome together. The hip is joined to the pelvic girdle by\\nmany muscles. In the gluteal region, the psoas major\\nand iliacus form the iliopsoas. The large and strong\\ngluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus\\nminimus extend and abduct the femur. Along with the\\ngluteus maximus, the tensor fascia lata muscle forms\\nthe iliotibial tract. The lateral rotators of the femur at\\nthe hip are the piriformis, obturator internus, obturator\\nexternus, superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and\\nquadratus femoris. On the medial part of the thigh, the\\nadductor longus, adductor brevis, and adductor\\nmagnus adduct the thigh and medially rotate it. The\\npectineus muscle adducts and flexes the femur at the\\nhip.\\nThe thigh muscles that move the femur, tibia, and\\nfibula are divided into medial, anterior, and posterior\\ncompartments. The medial compartment includes the\\nadductors, pectineus, and the gracilis. The anterior\\ncompartment comprises the quadriceps femoris,\\nquadriceps tendon, patellar ligament, and the\\nsartorius. The quadriceps femoris is made of four\\nmuscles: the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the\\nvastus medius, and the vastus intermedius, which\\ntogether extend the knee. The posterior compartment\\nof the thigh includes the hamstrings: the biceps\\nfemoris, semitendinosus, and the semimembranosus,\\nwhich all flex the knee.\\nThe muscles of the leg that move the foot and toes are\\ndivided into anterior, lateral, superficial- and deep-\\nposterior compartments. The anterior compartment\\nincludes the tibialis anterior, the extensor hallucis\\nlongus, the extensor digitorum longus, and the fibularis\\n(peroneus) tertius. The lateral compartment houses\\nthe fibularis (peroneus) longus and the fibularis\\n(peroneus) brevis. The superficial posterior\\ncompartment has the gastrocnemius, soleus, and\\nplantaris; and the deep posterior compartment has the\\npopliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus,\\nand flexor hallucis longus.\\nReview Questions\\n1.

In Peter D.

That quote is from the early 1990s; in the two\\ndecades since, progress has continued at an amazing rate within the scientific disciplines of neuroscience. It is an\\ninteresting conundrum to consider that the complexity of the nervous system may be too complex for it (that is, for\\nus) to completely unravel. But our current level of understanding is probably nowhere close to that limit.\\nOne easy way to begin to understand the structure of the nervous system is to start with the large divisions and work\\nthrough to a more in-depth understanding. In other chapters, the finer details of the nervous system will be\\nexplained, but first looking at an overview of the system will allow you to begin to understand how its parts work\\ntogether. The focus of this chapter is on nervous (neural) tissue, both its structure and its function. But before you\\nlearn about that, you will see a big picture of the system—actually, a few big pictures.\\nFigure 12.1 Robotic Arms Playing Foosball As the neural circuitry of the nervous system has become more fully understood and\\nrobotics more sophisticated, it is now possible to integrate technology with the body and restore abilities following traumatic events.

That suggests\\nit is made of two organs—and you may not even think of the spinal cord as an organ—but the nervous system is a\\nvery complex structure. Within the brain, many different and separate regions are responsible for many different and\\nseparate functions. It is as if the nervous system is composed of many organs that all look similar and can only be\\ndifferentiated using tools such as the microscope or electrophysiology. In comparison, it is easy to see that the\\nstomach is different than the esophagus or the liver, so you can imagine the digestive system as a collection of\\nspecific organs.\\nThe Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems\\nThe nervous system can be divided into two major regions: the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central\\nnervous system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else\\n(Figure 12.2). The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the\\nvertebral cavity of the vertebral column. It is a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside these\\ntwo cavities and the peripheral nervous system is outside of them, but that is one way to start to think about it. In\\nactuality, there are some elements of the peripheral nervous system that are within the cranial or vertebral cavities.\\nThe peripheral nervous system is so named because it is on the periphery—meaning beyond the brain and spinal\\ncord. Depending on different aspects of the nervous system, the dividing line between central and peripheral is not\\nnecessarily universal.\\nFIGURE 12.2 Central and Peripheral Nervous System The structures of the PNS are referred to as ganglia and nerves, which can be\\nseen as distinct structures. The equivalent structures in the CNS are not obvious from this overall perspective and are best examined in\\nprepared tissue under the microscope.\\nNervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic types of cells: neurons and glial cells.

There is one important process that every neuron has called an axon, which is\\nthe fiber that connects a neuron with its target. Another type of process that branches off from the soma is the\\ndendrite. Dendrites are responsible for receiving most of the input from other neurons. Looking at nervous tissue,\\nthere are regions that predominantly contain cell bodies and regions that are largely composed of just axons. These\\ntwo regions within nervous system structures are often referred to as gray matter (the regions with many cell\\nbodies and dendrites) or white matter (the regions with many axons). Figure 12.3 demonstrates the appearance of\\nthese regions in the brain and spinal cord. The colors ascribed to these regions are what would be seen in “fresh,” or\\nunstained, nervous tissue. Gray matter is not necessarily gray. It can be pinkish because of blood content, or even\\nslightly tan, depending on how long the tissue has been preserved. But white matter is white because axons are\\ninsulated by a lipid-rich substance called myelin. Lipids can appear as white (“fatty”) material, much like the fat on\\na raw piece of chicken or beef. Actually, gray matter may have that color ascribed to it because next to the white\\nmatter, it is just darker—hence, gray.\\nThe distinction between gray matter and white matter is most often applied to central nervous tissue, which has\\nlarge regions that can be seen with the unaided eye. When looking at peripheral structures, often a microscope is\\nused and the tissue is stained with artificial colors. That is not to say that central nervous tissue cannot be stained\\nand viewed under a microscope, but unstained tissue is most likely from the CNS—for example, a frontal section of\\nthe brain or cross section of the spinal cord.\\nFIGURE 12.3 Gray Matter and White Matter A brain removed during an autopsy, with a partial section removed, shows white matter\\nsurrounded by gray matter. Gray matter makes up the outer cortex of the brain. (credit: modification of work by “Suseno”/Wikimedia\\nCommons)\\nRegardless of the appearance of stained or unstained tissue, the cell bodies of neurons or axons can be located in\\ndiscrete anatomical structures that need to be named. Those names are specific to whether the structure is central\\nor peripheral. A localized collection of neuron cell bodies in the CNS is referred to as a nucleus. In the PNS, a cluster\\nof neuron cell bodies is referred to as a ganglion. Figure 12.4 indicates how the term nucleus has a few different\\nmeanings within anatomy and physiology. It is the center of an atom, where protons and neutrons are found; it is the\\ncenter of a cell, where the DNA is found; and it is a center of some function in the CNS. There is also a potentially\\nconfusing use of the word ganglion (plural = ganglia) that has a historical explanation. In the central nervous system,\\nthere is a group of nuclei that are connected together and were once called the basal ganglia before “ganglion”\\nbecame accepted as a description for a peripheral structure. Some sources refer to this group of nuclei as the “basal\\nnuclei” to avoid confusion.\\n12.1 • Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System 453'),\n",

(c) A nucleus in the CNS is a localized center of function with the cell bodies of several neurons, shown here\\ncircled in red. (credit c: “Was a bee”/Wikimedia Commons)\\nTerminology applied to bundles of axons also differs depending on location. A bundle of axons, or fibers, found in\\nthe CNS is called a tract whereas the same thing in the PNS would be called a nerve. There is an important point to\\nmake about these terms, which is that they can both be used to refer to the same bundle of axons. When those\\naxons are in the PNS, the term is nerve, but if they are CNS, the term is tract. The most obvious example of this is the\\naxons that project from the retina into the brain. Those axons are called the optic nerve as they leave the eye, but\\nwhen they are inside the cranium, they are referred to as the optic tract. There is a specific place where the name\\nchanges, which is the optic chiasm, but they are still the same axons (Figure 12.5). A similar situation outside of\\nscience can be described for some roads. Imagine a road called “Broad Street” in a town called “Anyville.” The road\\nleaves Anyville and goes to the next town over, called “Hometown.” When the road crosses the line between the two\\ntowns and is in Hometown, its name changes to “Main Street.” That is the idea behind the naming of the retinal\\naxons. In the PNS, they are called the optic nerve, and in the CNS, they are the optic tract. Table 12.1 helps to clarify\\nwhich of these terms apply to the central or peripheral nervous systems.\\nFIGURE 12.5 Optic Nerve Versus Optic Tract This drawing of the connections of the eye to the brain shows the optic nerve extending\\nfrom the eye to the chiasm, where the structure continues as the optic tract. The same axons extend from the eye to the brain through\\nthese two bundles of fibers, but the chiasm represents the border between peripheral and central.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nIn 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul C.

The CNS and the PNS both contribute to the same functions, but those functions can be\\nattributed to different regions of the brain (such as the cerebral cortex or the hypothalamus) or to different ganglia in\\nthe periphery. The problem with trying to fit functional differences into anatomical divisions is that sometimes the\\nsame structure can be part of several functions. For example, the optic nerve carries signals from the retina that are\\neither used for the conscious perception of visual stimuli, which takes place in the cerebral cortex, or for the\\nreflexive responses of smooth muscle tissue that are processed through the hypothalamus.\\nThere are two ways to consider how the nervous system is divided functionally. First, the basic functions of the\\nnervous system are sensation, integration, and response. Secondly, control of the body can be somatic or\\nautonomic—divisions that are largely defined by the structures that are involved in the response. There is also a\\nregion of the peripheral nervous system that is called the enteric nervous system that is responsible for a specific\\nset of the functions within the realm of autonomic control related to gastrointestinal functions.\\nBasic Functions\\nThe nervous system is involved in receiving information about the environment around us (sensation) and\\ngenerating responses to that information (motor responses). The nervous system can be divided into regions that\\nare responsible for sensation (sensory functions) and for the response (motor functions). But there is a third\\nfunction that needs to be included. Sensory input needs to be integrated with other sensations, as well as with\\nmemories, emotional state, or learning (cognition). Some regions of the nervous system are termed integration or\\nassociation areas. The process of integration combines sensory perceptions and higher cognitive functions such as\\nmemories, learning, and emotion to produce a response.\\nSensation. The first major function of the nervous system is sensation—receiving information about the environment\\nto gain input about what is happening outside the body (or, sometimes, within the body). The sensory functions of\\nthe nervous system register the presence of a change from homeostasis or a particular event in the environment,\\nknown as a stimulus. The senses we think of most are the “big five”: taste, smell, touch, sight, and hearing. The\\nstimuli for taste and smell are both chemical substances (molecules, compounds, ions, etc.), touch is physical or\\nmechanical stimuli that interact with the skin, sight is light stimuli, and hearing is the perception of sound, which is a\\nphysical stimulus similar to some aspects of touch. There are actually more senses than just those, but that list\\nrepresents the major senses. Those five are all senses that receive stimuli from the outside world, and of which\\nthere is conscious perception. Additional sensory stimuli might be from the internal environment (inside the body),\\nsuch as the stretch of an organ wall or the concentration of certain ions in the blood.\\nResponse. The nervous system produces a response on the basis of the stimuli perceived by sensory structures. An\\nobvious response would be the movement of muscles, such as withdrawing a hand from a hot stove, but there are\\n12.1 • Basic Structure and Function of the Nervous System 455'),\n",

The nervous system can cause the contraction of all three types of muscle tissue. For\\nexample, skeletal muscle contracts to move the skeleton, cardiac muscle is influenced as heart rate increases\\nduring exercise, and smooth muscle contracts as the digestive system moves food along the digestive tract.\\nResponses also include the neural control of glands in the body as well, such as the production and secretion of\\nsweat by the eccrine and merocrine sweat glands found in the skin to lower body temperature.\\nResponses can be divided into those that are voluntary or conscious (contraction of skeletal muscle) and those that\\nare involuntary (contraction of smooth muscles, regulation of cardiac muscle, activation of glands). Voluntary\\nresponses are governed by the somatic nervous system and involuntary responses are governed by the autonomic\\nnervous system, which are discussed in the next section.\\nIntegration. Stimuli that are received by sensory structures are communicated to the nervous system where that\\ninformation is processed. This is called integration. Stimuli are compared with, or integrated with, other stimuli,\\nmemories of previous stimuli, or the state of a person at a particular time. This leads to the specific response that\\nwill be generated. Seeing a baseball pitched to a batter will not automatically cause the batter to swing. The\\ntrajectory of the ball and its speed will need to be considered. Maybe the count is three balls and one strike, and the\\nbatter wants to let this pitch go by in the hope of getting a walk to first base. Or maybe the batter’s team is so far\\nahead, it would be fun to just swing away.\\nControlling the Body\\nThe nervous system can be divided into two parts mostly on the basis of a functional difference in responses. The\\nsomatic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for conscious perception and voluntary motor responses. Voluntary\\nmotor response means the contraction of skeletal muscle, but those contractions are not always voluntary in the\\nsense that you have to want to perform them. Some somatic motor responses are reflexes, and often happen\\nwithout a conscious decision to perform them. If your friend jumps out from behind a corner and yells “Boo!” you\\nwill be startled and you might scream or leap back. You didn’t decide to do that, and you may not have wanted to\\ngive your friend a reason to laugh at your expense, but it is a reflex involving skeletal muscle contractions. Other\\nmotor responses become automatic (in other words, unconscious) as a person learns motor skills (referred to as\\n“habit learning” or “procedural memory”).\\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for involuntary control of the body, usually for the sake of\\nhomeostasis (regulation of the internal environment). Sensory input for autonomic functions can be from sensory\\nstructures tuned to external or internal environmental stimuli. The motor output extends to smooth and cardiac\\nmuscle as well as glandular tissue. The role of the autonomic system is to regulate the organ systems of the body,\\nwhich usually means to control homeostasis. Sweat glands, for example, are controlled by the autonomic system.\\nWhen you are hot, sweating helps cool your body down. That is a homeostatic mechanism. But when you are\\nnervous, you might start sweating also. That is not homeostatic, it is the physiological response to an emotional\\nstate.\\nThere is another division of the nervous system that describes functional responses. The enteric nervous system\\n(ENS) is responsible for controlling the smooth muscle and glandular tissue in your digestive system. It is a large\\npart of the PNS, and is not dependent on the CNS. It is sometimes valid, however, to consider the enteric system to\\nbe a part of the autonomic system because the neural structures that make up the enteric system are a component\\nof the autonomic output that regulates digestion. There are some differences between the two, but for our purposes\\nhere there will be a good bit of overlap. See Figure 12.6 for examples of where these divisions of the nervous system\\ncan be found.\\n456 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Neurons are important, but\\nwithout glial support they would not be able to perform their function.\\nFIGURE 12.7 fMRI This fMRI shows activation of the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli.

A photograph of a face is projected on\\nthe screen away from the center. The subject has to look at the photograph and decipher what it is. The subject\\nhas been instructed to push a button if the photograph is of someone they recognize.

Those\\nareas are distributed all around the brain and the fMRI images would show activity in more than just 10 percent\\nof the brain (some evidence suggests that about 80 percent of the brain is using energy—based on blood flow to\\nthe tissue—during well-defined tasks similar to the one suggested above). This task does not even include all of\\nthe functions the brain performs.

They are responsible for the electrical signals\\nthat communicate information about sensations, and that produce movements in response to those stimuli, along\\nwith inducing thought processes within the brain. An important part of the function of neurons is in their structure,\\nor shape. The three-dimensional shape of these cells makes the immense numbers of connections within the\\nnervous system possible.\\nParts of a Neuron\\nAs you learned in the first section, the main part of a neuron is the cell body, which is also known as the soma (soma\\n= “body”). The cell body contains the nucleus and most of the major organelles. But what makes neurons special is\\nthat they have many extensions of their cell membranes, which are generally referred to as processes. Neurons are\\nusually described as having one, and only one, axon—a fiber that emerges from the cell body and projects to target\\ncells. That single axon can branch repeatedly to communicate with many target cells. It is the axon that propagates\\nthe nerve impulse, which is communicated to one or more cells. The other processes of the neuron are dendrites,\\nwhich receive information from other neurons at specialized areas of contact called synapses. The dendrites are\\nusually highly branched processes, providing locations for other neurons to communicate with the cell body.\\nInformation flows through a neuron from the dendrites, across the cell body, and down the axon. This gives the\\nneuron a polarity—meaning that information flows in this one direction. Figure 12.8 shows the relationship of these\\nparts to one another.\\nFIGURE 12.8 Parts of a Neuron The major parts of the neuron are labeled on a multipolar neuron from the CNS.\\nWhere the axon emerges from the cell body, there is a special region referred to as the axon hillock. This is a\\ntapering of the cell body toward the axon fiber. Within the axon hillock, the cytoplasm changes to a solution of\\nlimited components called axoplasm. Because the axon hillock represents the beginning of the axon, it is also\\nreferred to as the initial segment.\\nMany axons are wrapped by an insulating substance called myelin, which is actually made from glial cells. Myelin\\nacts as insulation much like the plastic or rubber that is used to insulate electrical wires. A key difference between\\nmyelin and the insulation on a wire is that there are gaps in the myelin covering of an axon. Each gap is called a node\\nof Ranvier and is important to the way that electrical signals travel down the axon. The length of the axon between\\neach gap, which is wrapped in myelin, is referred to as an axon segment. At the end of the axon is the axon\\nterminal, where there are usually several branches extending toward the target cell, each of which ends in an\\nenlargement called a synaptic end bulb. These bulbs are what make the connection with the target cell at the\\nsynapse.\\nTypes of Neurons\\nThere are many neurons in the nervous system—a number in the trillions. And there are many different types of\\nneurons. They can be classified by many different criteria. The first way to classify them is by the number of\\nprocesses attached to the cell body. Using the standard model of neurons, one of these processes is the axon, and\\n12.2 • Nervous Tissue 459'),\n",

Because information flows through the neuron from dendrites or cell bodies toward the axon,\\nthese names are based on the neuron's polarity (Figure 12.9).\\nFIGURE 12.9 Neuron Classification by Shape Unipolar cells have one process that includes both the axon and dendrite. Bipolar cells\\nhave two processes, the axon and a dendrite. Multipolar cells have more than two processes, the axon and two or more dendrites.\\nUnipolar cells have only one process emerging from the cell. True unipolar cells are only found in invertebrate\\nanimals, so the unipolar cells in humans are more appropriately called “pseudo-unipolar” cells. Invertebrate\\nunipolar cells do not have dendrites. Human unipolar cells have an axon that emerges from the cell body, but it splits\\nso that the axon can extend along a very long distance. At one end of the axon are dendrites, and at the other end,\\nthe axon forms synaptic connections with a target. Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons and have two\\nunique characteristics. First, their dendrites are receiving sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus\\nitself. Secondly, the cell bodies of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory reception is a peripheral\\nfunction (those dendrites are in the periphery, perhaps in the skin) so the cell body is in the periphery, though closer\\nto the CNS in a ganglion. The axon projects from the dendrite endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into the\\ncentral nervous system.\\nBipolar cells have two processes, which extend from each end of the cell body, opposite to each other. One is the\\naxon and one the dendrite. Bipolar cells are not very common. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium\\n(where smell stimuli are sensed), and as part of the retina.\\nMultipolar neurons are all of the neurons that are not unipolar or bipolar. They have one axon and two or more\\ndendrites (usually many more). With the exception of the unipolar sensory ganglion cells, and the two specific\\nbipolar cells mentioned above, all other neurons are multipolar. Some cutting edge research suggests that certain\\nneurons in the CNS do not conform to the standard model of “one, and only one” axon. Some sources describe a\\nfourth type of neuron, called an anaxonic neuron. The name suggests that it has no axon (an- = “without”), but this\\nis not accurate. Anaxonic neurons are very small, and if you look through a microscope at the standard resolution\\nused in histology (approximately 400X to 1000X total magnification), you will not be able to distinguish any process\\nspecifically as an axon or a dendrite. Any of those processes can function as an axon depending on the conditions at\\nany given time. Nevertheless, even if they cannot be easily seen, and one specific process is definitively the axon,\\nthese neurons have multiple processes and are therefore multipolar.\\nNeurons can also be classified on the basis of where they are found, who found them, what they do, or even what\\nchemicals they use to communicate with each other. Some neurons referred to in this section on the nervous system\\nare named on the basis of those sorts of classifications (Figure 12.10). For example, a multipolar neuron that has a\\nvery important role to play in a part of the brain called the cerebellum is known as a Purkinje (commonly\\npronounced per-KIN-gee) cell. It is named after the anatomist who discovered it (Jan Evangelista Purkinje,\\n1787–1869).\\n460 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

They are considered to be\\nsupporting cells, and many functions are directed at helping neurons complete their function for communication.\\nThe name glia comes from the Greek word that means “glue,” and was coined by the German pathologist Rudolph\\nVirchow, who wrote in 1856: “This connective substance, which is in the brain, the spinal cord, and the special\\nsense nerves, is a kind of glue (neuroglia) in which the nervous elements are planted.” Today, research into nervous\\ntissue has shown that there are many deeper roles that these cells play. And research may find much more about\\nthem in the future.\\nThere are six types of glial cells. Four of them are found in the CNS and two are found in the PNS.

Those processes extend to interact with neurons, blood\\nvessels, or the connective tissue covering the CNS that is called the pia mater (Figure 12.11).

The\\nblood-brain barrier is a physiological barrier that keeps many substances that circulate in the rest of the body from\\ngetting into the central nervous system, restricting what can cross from circulating blood into the CNS. Nutrient\\nmolecules, such as glucose or amino acids, can pass through the BBB, but other molecules cannot. This actually\\ncauses problems with drug delivery to the CNS. Pharmaceutical companies are challenged to design drugs that can\\ncross the BBB as well as have an effect on the nervous system.\\nFIGURE 12.11 Glial Cells of the CNS The CNS has astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells that support the\\nneurons of the CNS in several ways.\\nLike a few other parts of the body, the brain has a privileged blood supply. Very little can pass through by diffusion.\\nMost substances that cross the wall of a blood vessel into the CNS must do so through an active transport process.\\nBecause of this, only specific types of molecules can enter the CNS. Glucose—the primary energy source—is\\nallowed, as are amino acids. Water and some other small particles, like gases and ions, can enter. But most\\neverything else cannot, including white blood cells, which are one of the body’s main lines of defense. While this\\nbarrier protects the CNS from exposure to toxic or pathogenic substances, it also keeps out the cells that could\\nprotect the brain and spinal cord from disease and damage. The BBB also makes it harder for pharmaceuticals to be\\ndeveloped that can affect the nervous system. Aside from finding efficacious substances, the means of delivery is\\nalso crucial.\\nAlso found in CNS tissue is the oligodendrocyte, sometimes called just “oligo,” which is the glial cell type that\\ninsulates axons in the CNS. The name means “cell of a few branches” (oligo- = “few”; dendro- = “branches”; -cyte =\\n“cell”). There are a few processes that extend from the cell body. Each one reaches out and surrounds an axon to\\ninsulate it in myelin. One oligodendrocyte will provide the myelin for multiple axon segments, either for the same\\naxon or for separate axons. The function of myelin will be discussed below.\\nMicroglia are, as the name implies, smaller than most of the other glial cells. Ongoing research into these cells,\\nalthough not entirely conclusive, suggests that they may originate as white blood cells, called macrophages, that\\nbecome part of the CNS during early development. While their origin is not conclusively determined, their function is\\nrelated to what macrophages do in the rest of the body. When macrophages encounter diseased or damaged cells in\\nthe rest of the body, they ingest and digest those cells or the pathogens that cause disease. Microglia are the cells in\\nthe CNS that can do this in normal, healthy tissue, and they are therefore also referred to as CNS-resident\\nmacrophages.\\nThe ependymal cell is a glial cell that filters blood to make cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that circulates\\nthrough the CNS. Because of the privileged blood supply inherent in the BBB, the extracellular space in nervous\\ntissue does not easily exchange components with the blood. Ependymal cells line each ventricle, one of four central\\n462 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The choroid plexus is a specialized structure in the ventricles where ependymal cells come in contact with\\nblood vessels and filter and absorb components of the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid. Because of this,\\nependymal cells can be considered a component of the BBB, or a place where the BBB breaks down. These glial\\ncells appear similar to epithelial cells, making a single layer of cells with little intracellular space and tight\\nconnections between adjacent cells. They also have cilia on their apical surface to help move the CSF through the\\nventricular space. The relationship of these glial cells to the structure of the CNS is seen in Figure 12.11.\\nGlial Cells of the PNS\\nOne of the two types of glial cells found in the PNS is the satellite cell. Satellite cells are found in sensory and\\nautonomic ganglia, where they surround the cell bodies of neurons. This accounts for the name, based on their\\nappearance under the microscope. They provide support, performing similar functions in the periphery as astrocytes\\ndo in the CNS—except, of course, for establishing the BBB.\\nThe second type of glial cell is the Schwann cell, which insulate axons with myelin in the periphery. Schwann cells\\nare different than oligodendrocytes, in that a Schwann cell wraps around a portion of only one axon segment and no\\nothers. Oligodendrocytes have processes that reach out to multiple axon segments, whereas the entire Schwann\\ncell surrounds just one axon segment. The nucleus and cytoplasm of the Schwann cell are on the edge of the myelin\\nsheath. The relationship of these two types of glial cells to ganglia and nerves in the PNS is seen in Figure 12.12.\\nFIGURE 12.12 Glial Cells of the PNS The PNS has satellite cells and Schwann cells.\\nMyelin\\nThe insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann\\ncells in the PNS. Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it\\ninsulates is different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations. Myelin is a\\nlipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission\\nof electrical signals along the axon. The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane. Myelin,\\nhowever, is more than just the membrane of the glial cell. It also includes important proteins that are integral to that\\nmembrane. Some of the proteins help to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together.\\nThe appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for “pigs\\nin a blanket” or a similar food. The glial cell is wrapped around the axon several times with little to no cytoplasm\\nbetween the glial cell layers. For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell\\nprocess extends back toward the cell body. A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon\\nsegments in the area. For Schwann cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the\\nnucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the myelin sheath. During development, the glial cell is loosely or\\nincompletely wrapped around the axon (Figure 12.13a). The edges of this loose enclosure extend toward each\\nother, and one end tucks under the other. The inner edge wraps around the axon, creating several layers, and the\\nother edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed.\\n12.2 • Nervous Tissue 463'),\n",

So you put your hand out into the spray of water. What happens next depends on how\\nyour nervous system interacts with the stimulus of the water temperature and what you do in response to that\\nstimulus.\\nFound in the skin of your fingers or toes is a type of sensory receptor that is sensitive to temperature, called a\\nthermoreceptor. When you place your hand under the shower (Figure 12.15), the cell membrane of the\\nthermoreceptors changes its electrical state (voltage). The amount of change is dependent on the strength of the\\nstimulus (how hot the water is). This is called a graded potential. If the stimulus is strong, the voltage of the cell\\nmembrane will change enough to generate an electrical signal that will travel down the axon. You have learned\\nabout this type of signaling before, with respect to the interaction of nerves and muscles at the neuromuscular\\njunction. The voltage at which such a signal is generated is called the threshold, and the resulting electrical signal is\\ncalled an action potential. In this example, the action potential travels—a process known as propagation—along\\nthe axon from the axon hillock to the axon terminals and into the synaptic end bulbs. When this signal reaches the\\nend bulbs, it causes the release of a signaling molecule called a neurotransmitter.\\nFIGURE 12.15 The Sensory Input Receptors in the skin sense the temperature of the water.\\nThe neurotransmitter diffuses across the short distance of the synapse and binds to a receptor protein of the target\\nneuron. When the molecular signal binds to the receptor, the cell membrane of the target neuron changes its\\nelectrical state and a new graded potential begins. If that graded potential is strong enough to reach threshold, the\\nsecond neuron generates an action potential at its axon hillock. The target of this neuron is another neuron in the\\nthalamus of the brain, the part of the CNS that acts as a relay for sensory information.

For skeletal muscles to contract, based on\\nexcitation–contraction coupling, requires input from a neuron. Both of the cells make use of the cell membrane to\\nregulate ion movement between the extracellular fluid and cytosol.\\nAs you learned in the chapter on cells, the cell membrane is primarily responsible for regulating what can cross the\\nmembrane and what stays on only one side. The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer, so only substances that\\ncan pass directly through the hydrophobic core can diffuse through unaided. Charged particles, which are\\nhydrophilic by definition, cannot pass through the cell membrane without assistance (Figure 12.17).\\nTransmembrane proteins, specifically channel proteins, make this possible. Several passive transport channels, as\\nwell as active transport pumps, are necessary to generate a transmembrane potential and an action potential. Of\\nspecial interest is the carrier protein referred to as the sodium/potassium pump that moves sodium ions (Na+) out of\\na cell and potassium ions (K+) into a cell, thus regulating ion concentration on both sides of the cell membrane.\\nFIGURE 12.17 Cell Membrane and Transmembrane Proteins The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer and has many\\ntransmembrane proteins, including different types of channel proteins that serve as ion channels.\\nThe sodium/potassium pump requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so it is also referred to as\\nan ATPase.

Proteins are capable of spanning the cell membrane, including its hydrophobic core, and can\\ninteract with the charge of ions because of the varied properties of amino acids found within specific domains or\\nregions of the protein channel. Hydrophobic amino acids are found in the domains that are apposed to the\\nhydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids. Hydrophilic amino acids are exposed to the fluid environments of the\\nextracellular fluid and cytosol. Additionally, the ions will interact with the hydrophilic amino acids, which will be\\nselective for the charge of the ion. Channels for cations (positive ions) will have negatively charged side chains in the\\npore. Channels for anions (negative ions) will have positively charged side chains in the pore. This is called\\nelectrochemical exclusion, meaning that the channel pore is charge-specific.\\nIon channels can also be specified by the diameter of the pore. The distance between the amino acids will be\\nspecific for the diameter of the ion when it dissociates from the water molecules surrounding it. Because of the\\nsurrounding water molecules, larger pores are not ideal for smaller ions because the water molecules will interact,\\nby hydrogen bonds, more readily than the amino acid side chains. This is called size exclusion. Some ion channels\\nare selective for charge but not necessarily for size, and thus are called a nonspecific channel. These nonspecific\\nchannels allow cations—particularly Na+, K+, and Ca2+—to cross the membrane, but exclude anions.\\nIon channels do not always freely allow ions to diffuse across the membrane. Some are opened by certain events,\\nmeaning the channels are gated. So another way that channels can be categorized is on the basis of how they are\\ngated. Although these classes of ion channels are found primarily in the cells of nervous or muscular tissue, they\\nalso can be found in the cells of epithelial and connective tissues.\\nA ligand-gated channel opens because a signaling molecule, a ligand, binds to the extracellular region of the\\nchannel. This type of channel is also known as an ionotropic receptor because when the ligand, known as a\\nneurotransmitter in the nervous system, binds to the protein, ions cross the membrane changing its charge (Figure\\n12.18).\\nFIGURE 12.18 Ligand-Gated Channels When the ligand, in this case the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, binds to a specific location on\\nthe extracellular surface of the channel protein, the pore opens to allow select ions through. The ions, in this case, are cations of sodium,\\ncalcium, and potassium.\\nA mechanically gated channel opens because of a physical distortion of the cell membrane. Many channels\\nassociated with the sense of touch (somatosensation) are mechanically gated. For example, as pressure is applied\\nto the skin, these channels open and allow ions to enter the cell. Similar to this type of channel would be the\\nchannel that opens on the basis of temperature changes, as in testing the water in the shower (Figure 12.19).\\n12.4 • The Action Potential 469'),\n",

The particular electrical\\nproperties of certain cells are modified by the presence of this type of channel.\\nThe Membrane Potential\\nThe electrical state of the cell membrane can have several variations. These are all variations in the membrane\\npotential. A potential is a distribution of charge across the cell membrane, measured in millivolts (mV). The\\nstandard is to compare the inside of the cell relative to the outside, so the membrane potential is a value\\nrepresenting the charge on the intracellular side of the membrane based on the outside being zero, relatively\\nspeaking (Figure 12.22).\\nFIGURE 12.22 Measuring Charge across a Membrane with a Voltmeter A recording electrode is inserted into the cell and a\\nreference electrode is outside the cell. By comparing the charge measured by these two electrodes, the transmembrane voltage is\\ndetermined. It is conventional to express that value for the cytosol relative to the outside.\\nThe concentration of ions in extracellular and intracellular fluids is largely balanced, with a net neutral charge.\\nHowever, a slight difference in charge occurs right at the membrane surface, both internally and externally. It is the\\ndifference in this very limited region that has all the power in neurons (and muscle cells) to generate electrical\\nsignals, including action potentials.\\nBefore these electrical signals can be described, the resting state of the membrane must be explained. When the\\ncell is at rest, and the ion channels are closed (except for leakage channels which randomly open), ions are\\ndistributed across the membrane in a very predictable way. The concentration of Na+ outside the cell is 10 times\\ngreater than the concentration inside. Also, the concentration of K+ inside the cell is greater than outside. The\\ncytosol contains a high concentration of anions, in the form of phosphate ions and negatively charged proteins.\\n12.4 • The Action Potential 471'),\n",

The exact value measured for the resting membrane\\npotential varies between cells, but -70 mV is most commonly used as this value. This voltage would actually be\\nmuch lower except for the contributions of some important proteins in the membrane. Leakage channels allow Na+\\nto slowly move into the cell or K+ to slowly move out, and the Na+/K+ pump restores them. This may appear to be a\\nwaste of energy, but each has a role in maintaining the membrane potential.\\nThe Action Potential\\nResting membrane potential describes the steady state of the cell, which is a dynamic process that is balanced by\\nion leakage and ion pumping. Without any outside influence, it will not change. To get an electrical signal started, the\\nmembrane potential has to change.\\nThis starts with a channel opening for Na+ in the membrane. Because the concentration of Na+ is higher outside the\\ncell than inside the cell by a factor of 10, ions will rush into the cell that are driven largely by the concentration\\ngradient. Because sodium is a positively charged ion, it will change the relative voltage immediately inside the cell\\nrelative to immediately outside. The resting potential is the state of the membrane at a voltage of -70 mV, so the\\nsodium cation entering the cell will cause it to become less negative. This is known as depolarization, meaning the\\nmembrane potential moves toward zero.\\nThe concentration gradient for Na+ is so strong that it will continue to enter the cell even after the membrane\\npotential has become zero, so that the voltage immediately around the pore begins to become positive. The\\nelectrical gradient also plays a role, as negative proteins below the membrane attract the sodium ion. The\\nmembrane potential will reach +30 mV by the time sodium has entered the cell.\\nAs the membrane potential reaches +30 mV, other voltage-gated channels are opening in the membrane. These\\nchannels are specific for the potassium ion. A concentration gradient acts on K+, as well. As K+ starts to leave the\\ncell, taking a positive charge with it, the membrane potential begins to move back toward its resting voltage. This is\\ncalled repolarization, meaning that the membrane voltage moves back toward the -70 mV value of the resting\\nmembrane potential.\\nRepolarization returns the membrane potential to the -70 mV value that indicates the resting potential, but it\\nactually overshoots that value. Potassium ions reach equilibrium when the membrane voltage is below -70 mV, so a\\nperiod of hyperpolarization occurs while the K+ channels are open. Those K+ channels are slightly delayed in closing,\\naccounting for this short overshoot.\\nWhat has been described here is the action potential, which is presented as a graph of voltage over time in Figure\\n12.23. It is the electrical signal that nervous tissue generates for communication. The change in the membrane\\nvoltage from -70 mV at rest to +30 mV at the end of depolarization is a 100 mV change. That can also be written as a\\n0.1 V change. To put that value in perspective, think about a battery. An AA battery that you might find in a television\\nremote has a voltage of 1.5 V, or a 9 V battery (the rectangular battery with two posts on one end) is, obviously, 9 V.\\nThe change seen in the action potential is one or two orders of magnitude less than the charge in these batteries. In\\nfact, the membrane potential can be described as a battery. A charge is stored across the membrane that can be\\nreleased under the correct conditions.

View this animation (http://openstax.org/l/dynamic1) to learn more about\\nthis process. What is the difference between the driving force for Na+ and K+? And what is similar about the\\nmovement of these two ions?\\nThe question is, now, what initiates the action potential? The description above conveniently glosses over that point.\\nBut it is vital to understanding what is happening. The membrane potential will stay at the resting voltage until\\nsomething changes. The description above just says that a Na+ channel opens. Now, to say “a channel opens” does\\nnot mean that one individual transmembrane protein changes. Instead, it means that one kind of channel opens.\\nThere are a few different types of channels that allow Na+ to cross the membrane. A ligand-gated Na+ channel will\\nopen when a neurotransmitter binds to it and a mechanically gated Na+ channel will open when a physical stimulus\\naffects a sensory receptor (like pressure applied to the skin compresses a touch receptor). Whether it is a\\nneurotransmitter binding to its receptor protein or a sensory stimulus activating a sensory receptor cell, some\\nstimulus gets the process started. Sodium starts to enter the cell and the membrane becomes less negative.\\nA third type of channel that is an important part of depolarization in the action potential is the voltage-gated Na+\\nchannel. The channels that start depolarizing the membrane because of a stimulus help the cell to depolarize from\\n-70 mV to -55 mV. Once the membrane reaches that voltage, the voltage-gated Na+ channels open. This is what is\\nknown as the threshold. Any depolarization that does not change the membrane potential to -55 mV or higher will\\nnot reach threshold and thus will not result in an action potential. Also, any stimulus that depolarizes the membrane\\nto -55 mV or beyond will cause a large number of channels to open and an action potential will be initiated.\\nBecause of the threshold, the action potential can be likened to a digital event—it either happens or it does not. If\\nthe threshold is not reached, then no action potential occurs. If depolarization reaches -55 mV, then the action\\npotential continues and runs all the way to +30 mV, at which K+ causes repolarization, including the hyperpolarizing\\novershoot. Also, those changes are the same for every action potential, which means that once the threshold is\\nreached, the exact same thing happens. A stronger stimulus, which might depolarize the membrane well past\\nthreshold, will not make a “bigger” action potential. Action potentials are “all or none.” Either the membrane\\nreaches the threshold and everything occurs as described above, or the membrane does not reach the threshold\\nand nothing else happens. All action potentials peak at the same voltage (+30 mV), so one action potential is not\\nbigger than another. Stronger stimuli will initiate multiple action potentials more quickly, but the individual signals\\nare not bigger. Thus, for example, you will not feel a greater sensation of pain, or have a stronger muscle contraction,\\nbecause of the size of the action potential because they are not different sizes.\\nAs we have seen, the depolarization and repolarization of an action potential are dependent on two types of\\nchannels (the voltage-gated Na+ channel and the voltage-gated K+ channel).

One is the activation gate, which opens when the membrane potential crosses -55 mV. The other\\ngate is the inactivation gate, which closes after a specific period of time—on the order of a fraction of a millisecond.\\nWhen a cell is at rest, the activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open. However, when the threshold is\\nreached, the activation gate opens, allowing Na+ to rush into the cell. Timed with the peak of depolarization, the\\ninactivation gate closes. During repolarization, no more sodium can enter the cell. When the membrane potential\\npasses -55 mV again, the activation gate closes. After that, the inactivation gate re-opens, making the channel ready\\nto start the whole process over again.\\nThe voltage-gated K+ channel has only one gate, which is sensitive to a membrane voltage of -50 mV. However, it\\ndoes not open as quickly as the voltage-gated Na+ channel does. It might take a fraction of a millisecond for the\\nchannel to open once that voltage has been reached. The timing of this coincides exactly with when the Na+ flow\\npeaks, so voltage-gated K+ channels open just as the voltage-gated Na+ channels are being inactivated. As the\\nmembrane potential repolarizes and the voltage passes -50 mV again, the channel closes—again, with a little delay.\\nPotassium continues to leave the cell for a short while and the membrane potential becomes more negative,\\nresulting in the hyperpolarizing overshoot. Then the channel closes again and the membrane can return to the\\nresting potential because of the ongoing activity of the non-gated channels and the Na+/K+ pump.\\nAll of this takes place within approximately 2 milliseconds (Figure 12.24). While an action potential is in progress,\\nanother one cannot be initiated. That effect is referred to as the refractory period. There are two phases of the\\nrefractory period: the absolute refractory period and the relative refractory period. During the absolute phase,\\nanother action potential will not start. This is because of the inactivation gate of the voltage-gated Na+ channel.\\nOnce that channel is back to its resting conformation (less than -55 mV), a new action potential could be started, but\\nonly by a stronger stimulus than the one that initiated the current action potential. This is because of the flow of K+\\nout of the cell. Because that ion is rushing out, any Na+ that tries to enter will not depolarize the cell, but will only\\nkeep the cell from hyperpolarizing.\\nFIGURE 12.24 Stages of an Action Potential Plotting voltage measured across the cell membrane against time, the events of the\\naction potential can be related to specific changes in the membrane voltage.

(6) The membrane voltage returns to the resting value shortly after hyperpolarization.\\nPropagation of the Action Potential\\nThe action potential is initiated at the beginning of the axon, at what is called the initial segment. There is a high\\ndensity of voltage-gated Na+ channels so that rapid depolarization can take place here. Going down the length of the\\naxon, the action potential is propagated because more voltage-gated Na+ channels are opened as the depolarization\\nspreads. This spreading occurs because Na+ enters through the channel and moves along the inside of the cell\\nmembrane. As the Na+ moves, or flows, a short distance along the cell membrane, its positive charge depolarizes a\\nlittle more of the cell membrane. As that depolarization spreads, new voltage-gated Na+ channels open and more\\nions rush into the cell, spreading the depolarization a little farther.\\nBecause voltage-gated Na+ channels are inactivated at the peak of the depolarization, they cannot be opened again\\nfor a brief time—the absolute refractory period. Because of this, depolarization spreading back toward previously\\nopened channels has no effect.

When myelination is present, the action potential\\npropagates differently. Sodium ions that enter the cell at the initial segment start to spread along the length of the\\naxon segment, but there are no voltage-gated Na+ channels until the first node of Ranvier. Because there is not\\nconstant opening of these channels along the axon segment, the depolarization spreads at an optimal speed. The\\ndistance between nodes is the optimal distance to keep the membrane still depolarized above threshold at the next\\nnode. As Na+ spreads along the inside of the membrane of the axon segment, the charge starts to dissipate. If the\\nnode were any farther down the axon, that depolarization would have fallen off too much for voltage-gated Na+\\nchannels to be activated at the next node of Ranvier. If the nodes were any closer together, the speed of propagation\\nwould be slower.\\nPropagation along an unmyelinated axon is referred to as continuous conduction; along the length of a myelinated\\naxon, it is saltatory conduction. Continuous conduction is slow because there are always voltage-gated Na+\\nchannels opening, and more and more Na+ is rushing into the cell. Saltatory conduction is faster because the action\\npotential basically jumps from one node to the next (saltare = “to leap”), and the new influx of Na+ renews the\\ndepolarized membrane. Along with the myelination of the axon, the diameter of the axon can influence the speed of\\nconduction. Much as water runs faster in a wide river than in a narrow creek, Na+-based depolarization spreads\\nfaster down a wide axon than down a narrow one.

The\\nconcentrations of ions in the extracellular fluid are the basis for how the membrane potential is established and\\nchanges in electrochemical signaling. If the balance of ions is upset, drastic outcomes are possible.\\nNormally the concentration of K+ is higher inside the neuron than outside. After the repolarizing phase of the action\\npotential, K+ leakage channels and the Na+/K+ pump ensure that the ions return to their original locations. Following\\na stroke or other ischemic event, extracellular K+ levels are elevated. The astrocytes in the area are equipped to\\nclear excess K+ to aid the pump. But when the level is far out of balance, the effects can be irreversible.\\nAstrocytes can become reactive in cases such as these, which impairs their ability to maintain the local chemical\\nenvironment. The glial cells enlarge and their processes swell. They lose their K+ buffering ability and the function of\\nthe pump is affected, or even reversed.

If one cell is depolarized in an electrical synapse, the joined cell also depolarizes because\\nthe ions pass between the cells. Chemical synapses involve the transmission of chemical information from one cell\\nto the next. This section will concentrate on the chemical type of synapse.\\nAn example of a chemical synapse is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) described in the chapter on muscle tissue.\\nIn the nervous system, there are many more synapses that are essentially the same as the NMJ. All synapses have\\ncommon characteristics, which can be summarized in this list:\\n• presynaptic element\\n• neurotransmitter (packaged in vesicles)\\n• synaptic cleft\\n• receptor proteins\\n• postsynaptic element\\n• neurotransmitter elimination or re-uptake\\nFor the NMJ, these characteristics are as follows: the presynaptic element is the motor neuron's axon terminals, the\\nneurotransmitter is acetylcholine, the synaptic cleft is the space between the cells where the neurotransmitter\\ndiffuses, the receptor protein is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the postsynaptic element is the sarcolemma of\\nthe muscle cell, and the neurotransmitter is eliminated by acetylcholinesterase. Other synapses are similar to this,\\nand the specifics are different, but they all contain the same characteristics.\\nNeurotransmitter Release\\nWhen an action potential reaches the axon terminals, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the membrane of the synaptic\\nend bulb open. The concentration of Ca2+ increases inside the end bulb, and the Ca2+ ion associates with proteins in\\nthe outer surface of neurotransmitter vesicles. The Ca2+ facilitates the merging of the vesicle with the presynaptic\\nmembrane so that the neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis into the small gap between the cells, known\\nas the synaptic cleft.\\nOnce in the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitter diffuses the short distance to the postsynaptic membrane and can\\ninteract with neurotransmitter receptors. Receptors are specific for the neurotransmitter, and the two fit together\\nlike a key and lock. One neurotransmitter binds to its receptor and will not bind to receptors for other\\nneurotransmitters, making the binding a specific chemical event (Figure 12.27).\\n478 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

They are in the autonomic nervous system, as well as distributed throughout the\\nbrain.\\nThe cholinergic system has two types of receptors, the nicotinic receptor is found in the NMJ as well as other\\nsynapses. There is also an acetylcholine receptor known as the muscarinic receptor. Both of these receptors are\\nnamed for drugs that interact with the receptor in addition to acetylcholine.

However, nicotine will not bind to the muscarinic receptor and muscarine will not bind to the\\nnicotinic receptor.\\nAnother group of neurotransmitters are amino acids. This includes glutamate (Glu), GABA (gamma-aminobutyric\\nacid, a derivative of glutamate), and glycine (Gly). These amino acids have an amino group and a carboxyl group in\\ntheir chemical structures. Glutamate is one of the 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins. Each amino acid\\nneurotransmitter would be part of its own system, namely the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic systems.\\nThey each have their own receptors and do not interact with each other. Amino acid neurotransmitters are\\neliminated from the synapse by reuptake. A pump in the cell membrane of the presynaptic element, or sometimes a\\nneighboring glial cell, will clear the amino acid from the synaptic cleft so that it can be recycled, repackaged in\\nvesicles, and released again.\\n12.5 • Communication Between Neurons 479'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 495}, page_content='Another class of neurotransmitter is the biogenic amine, a group of neurotransmitters that are enzymatically made\\nfrom amino acids. They have amino groups in them, but no longer have carboxyl groups and are therefore no longer\\nclassified as amino acids. Serotonin is made from tryptophan. It is the basis of the serotonergic system, which has\\nits own specific receptors. Serotonin is transported back into the presynaptic cell for repackaging.\\nOther biogenic amines are made from tyrosine, and include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Dopamine\\nis part of its own system, the dopaminergic system, which has dopamine receptors. Dopamine is removed from the\\nsynapse by transport proteins in the presynaptic cell membrane. Norepinephrine and epinephrine belong to the\\nadrenergic neurotransmitter system. The two molecules are very similar and bind to the same receptors, which are\\nreferred to as alpha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are also transported back into the\\npresynaptic cell. The chemical epinephrine (epi- = “on”; “-nephrine” = kidney) is also known as adrenaline (renal =\\n“kidney”), and norepinephrine is sometimes referred to as noradrenaline. The adrenal gland produces epinephrine\\nand norepinephrine to be released into the blood stream as hormones.\\nA neuropeptide is a neurotransmitter molecule made up of chains of amino acids connected by peptide bonds. This\\nis what a protein is, but the term protein implies a certain length to the molecule. Some neuropeptides are quite\\nshort, such as met-enkephalin, which is five amino acids long. Others are long, such as beta-endorphin, which is 31\\namino acids long. Neuropeptides are often released at synapses in combination with another neurotransmitter, and\\nthey often act as hormones in other systems of the body, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or substance P.\\nThe effect of a neurotransmitter on the postsynaptic element is entirely dependent on the receptor protein. First, if\\nthere is no receptor protein in the membrane of the postsynaptic element, then the neurotransmitter has no effect.\\nThe depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effect is also dependent on the receptor. When acetylcholine binds to the\\nnicotinic receptor, the postsynaptic cell is depolarized. This is because the receptor is a cation channel and\\npositively charged Na+ will rush into the cell. However, when acetylcholine binds to the muscarinic receptor, of\\nwhich there are several variants, it might cause depolarization or hyperpolarization of the target cell.\\nThe amino acid neurotransmitters, glutamate, glycine, and GABA, are almost exclusively associated with just one\\neffect. Glutamate is considered an excitatory amino acid, but only because Glu receptors in the adult cause\\ndepolarization of the postsynaptic cell. Glycine and GABA are considered inhibitory amino acids, again because their\\nreceptors cause hyperpolarization.\\nThe biogenic amines have mixed effects. For example, the dopamine receptors that are classified as D1 receptors\\nare excitatory whereas D2-type receptors are inhibitory. Biogenic amine receptors and neuropeptide receptors can\\nhave even more complex effects because some may not directly affect the membrane potential, but rather have an\\neffect on gene transcription or other metabolic processes in the neuron. The characteristics of the various\\nneurotransmitter systems presented in this section are organized in Table 12.3.\\nThe important thing to remember about neurotransmitters, and signaling chemicals in general, is that the effect is\\nentirely dependent on the receptor. Neurotransmitters bind to one of two classes of receptors at the cell surface,\\nionotropic or metabotropic (Figure 12.28). Ionotropic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, such as the nicotinic\\nreceptor for acetylcholine or the glycine receptor. A metabotropic receptor involves a complex of proteins that\\nresult in metabolic changes within the cell. The receptor complex includes the transmembrane receptor protein, a G\\nprotein, and an effector protein. The neurotransmitter, referred to as the first messenger, binds to the receptor\\nprotein on the extracellular surface of the cell, and the intracellular side of the protein initiates activity of the G\\nprotein. The G protein is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolase that physically moves from the receptor protein\\nto the effector protein to activate the latter. An effector protein is an enzyme that catalyzes the generation of a new\\nmolecule, which acts as the intracellular mediator of the signal that binds to the receptor. This intracellular mediator\\nis called the second messenger.\\nDifferent receptors use different second messengers. Two common examples of second messengers are cyclic\\nadenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). The enzyme adenylate cyclase (an example of an\\neffector protein) makes cAMP, and phospholipase C is the enzyme that makes IP3. Second messengers, after they\\nare produced by the effector protein, cause metabolic changes within the cell. These changes are most likely the\\nactivation of other enzymes in the cell. In neurons, they often modify ion channels, either opening or closing them.\\nThese enzymes can also cause changes in the cell, such as the activation of genes in the nucleus, and therefore the\\nincreased synthesis of proteins. In neurons, these kinds of changes are often the basis of stronger connections\\n480 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

One of the strongest theories of what causes\\nAlzheimer’s disease is based on the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques, dense conglomerations of a protein\\nthat is not functioning correctly. Parkinson’s disease is linked to an increase in a protein known as alpha-\\nsynuclein that is toxic to the cells of the substantia nigra nucleus in the midbrain.\\nFor proteins to function correctly, they are dependent on their three-dimensional shape. The linear sequence of\\namino acids folds into a three-dimensional shape that is based on the interactions between and among those\\namino acids. When the folding is disturbed, and proteins take on a different shape, they stop functioning\\ncorrectly. But the disease is not necessarily the result of functional loss of these proteins; rather, these altered\\nproteins start to accumulate and may become toxic. For example, in Alzheimer’s, the hallmark of the disease is\\nthe accumulation of these amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex. The term coined to describe this sort of\\ndisease is “proteopathy” and it includes other diseases. Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, the human variant of the\\nprion disease known as mad cow disease in the bovine, also involves the accumulation of amyloid plaques,\\nsimilar to Alzheimer’s. Diseases of other organ systems can fall into this group as well, such as cystic fibrosis or\\ntype 2 diabetes. Recognizing the relationship between these diseases has suggested new therapeutic\\npossibilities. Interfering with the accumulation of the proteins, and possibly as early as their original production\\nwithin the cell, may unlock new ways to alleviate these devastating diseases.\\n482 12 • The Nervous System and Nervous Tissue\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The anatomical\\ndivisions are the central and peripheral nervous\\nsystems. The CNS is the brain and spinal cord. The PNS\\nis everything else. Functionally, the nervous system can\\nbe divided into those regions that are responsible for\\nsensation, those that are responsible for integration,\\nand those that are responsible for generating\\nresponses. All of these functional areas are found in\\nboth the central and peripheral anatomy.\\nConsidering the anatomical regions of the nervous\\nsystem, there are specific names for the structures\\nwithin each division. A localized collection of neuron\\ncell bodies is referred to as a nucleus in the CNS and as\\na ganglion in the PNS. A bundle of axons is referred to\\nas a tract in the CNS and as a nerve in the PNS.\\nWhereas nuclei and ganglia are specifically in the\\ncentral or peripheral divisions, axons can cross the\\nboundary between the two. A single axon can be part\\nof a nerve and a tract. The name for that specific\\nstructure depends on its location.\\nNervous tissue can also be described as gray matter\\nand white matter on the basis of its appearance in\\nunstained tissue. These descriptions are more often\\nused in the CNS. Gray matter is where nuclei are found\\nand white matter is where tracts are found. In the PNS,\\nganglia are basically gray matter and nerves are white\\nmatter.\\nThe nervous system can also be divided on the basis of\\nhow it controls the body. The somatic nervous system\\n(SNS) is responsible for functions that result in moving\\nskeletal muscles. Any sensory or integrative functions\\nthat result in the movement of skeletal muscle would\\nbe considered somatic. The autonomic nervous system\\n(ANS) is responsible for functions that affect cardiac or\\nsmooth muscle tissue, or that cause glands to produce\\ntheir secretions. Autonomic functions are distributed\\nbetween central and peripheral regions of the nervous\\nsystem. The sensations that lead to autonomic\\nfunctions can be the same sensations that are part of\\ninitiating somatic responses. Somatic and autonomic\\nintegrative functions may overlap as well.\\nA special division of the nervous system is the enteric\\nnervous system, which is responsible for controlling\\nthe digestive organs. Parts of the autonomic nervous\\nsystem overlap with the enteric nervous system. The\\nenteric nervous system is exclusively found in the\\nperiphery because it is the nervous tissue in the organs\\nof the digestive system.\\n12.2 Nervous Tissue\\nNervous tissue contains two major cell types, neurons\\nand glial cells. Neurons are the cells responsible for\\ncommunication through electrical signals. Glial cells\\nare supporting cells, maintaining the environment\\naround the neurons.\\nNeurons are polarized cells, based on the flow of\\nelectrical signals along their membrane. Signals are\\nreceived at the dendrites, are passed along the cell\\nbody, and propagate along the axon towards the target,\\nwhich may be another neuron, muscle tissue, or a\\ngland. Many axons are insulated by a lipid-rich\\nsubstance called myelin. Specific types of glial cells\\nprovide this insulation.\\nSeveral types of glial cells are found in the nervous\\nsystem, and they can be categorized by the anatomical\\ndivision in which they are found. In the CNS,\\nastrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and\\nependymal cells are found. Astrocytes are important\\nfor maintaining the chemical environment around the\\nneuron and are crucial for regulating the blood-brain\\nbarrier. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia in the\\nCNS. Microglia act as phagocytes and play a role in\\nimmune surveillance. Ependymal cells are responsible\\nfor filtering the blood to produce cerebrospinal fluid,\\nwhich is a circulatory fluid that performs some of the\\nfunctions of blood in the brain and spinal cord because\\nof the BBB. In the PNS, satellite cells are supporting\\ncells for the neurons, and Schwann cells insulate\\nperipheral axons.\\n12.3 The Function of Nervous Tissue\\nSensation starts with the activation of a sensory\\nending, such as the thermoreceptor in the skin sensing\\nthe temperature of the water. The sensory endings in\\nthe skin initiate an electrical signal that travels along\\nthe sensory axon within a nerve into the spinal cord,\\nwhere it synapses with a neuron in the gray matter of\\nthe spinal cord. The temperature information\\nrepresented in that electrical signal is passed to the\\nnext neuron by a chemical signal that diffuses across\\nthe small gap of the synapse and initiates a new\\nelectrical signal in the target cell. That signal travels\\nthrough the sensory pathway to the brain, passing\\nthrough the thalamus, where conscious perception of\\nthe water temperature is made possible by the\\ncerebral cortex.

The motor pathway is\\ncomposed of two cells, the upper motor neuron and\\nthe lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron has\\nits cell body in the cerebral cortex and synapses on a\\ncell in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The lower\\nmotor neuron is that cell in the gray matter of the\\nspinal cord and its axon extends into the periphery\\nwhere it synapses with a skeletal muscle in a\\nneuromuscular junction.\\n12.4 The Action Potential\\nThe nervous system is characterized by electrical\\nsignals that are sent from one area to another. Whether\\nthose areas are close or very far apart, the signal must\\ntravel along an axon. The basis of the electrical signal is\\nthe controlled distribution of ions across the\\nmembrane. Transmembrane ion channels regulate\\nwhen ions can move in or out of the cell, so that a\\nprecise signal is generated. This signal is the action\\npotential which has a very characteristic shape based\\non voltage changes across the membrane in a given\\ntime period.\\nThe membrane is normally at rest with established Na+\\nand K+ concentrations on either side. A stimulus will\\nstart the depolarization of the membrane, and voltage-\\ngated channels will result in further depolarization\\nfollowed by repolarization of the membrane. A slight\\novershoot of hyperpolarization marks the end of the\\naction potential. While an action potential is in\\nprogress, another cannot be generated under the same\\nconditions. While the voltage-gated Na+ channel is\\ninactivated, absolutely no action potentials can be\\ngenerated. Once that channel has returned to its\\nresting state, a new action potential is possible, but it\\nmust be started by a relatively stronger stimulus to\\novercome the K+ leaving the cell.\\nThe action potential travels down the axon as voltage-\\ngated ion channels are opened by the spreading\\ndepolarization. In unmyelinated axons, this happens in\\na continuous fashion because there are voltage-gated\\nchannels throughout the membrane. In myelinated\\naxons, propagation is described as saltatory because\\nvoltage-gated channels are only found at the nodes of\\nRanvier and the electrical events seem to “jump” from\\none node to the next. Saltatory conduction is faster\\nthan continuous conduction, meaning that myelinated\\naxons propagate their signals faster. The diameter of\\nthe axon also makes a difference as ions diffusing\\nwithin the cell have less resistance in a wider space.\\n12.5 Communication Between Neurons\\nThe basis of the electrical signal within a neuron is the\\naction potential that propagates down the axon. For a\\nneuron to generate an action potential, it needs to\\nreceive input from another source, either another\\nneuron or a sensory stimulus. That input will result in\\nopening ion channels in the neuron, resulting in a\\ngraded potential based on the strength of the stimulus.\\nGraded potentials can be depolarizing or\\nhyperpolarizing and can summate to affect the\\nprobability of the neuron reaching threshold.\\nGraded potentials can be the result of sensory stimuli.\\nIf the sensory stimulus is received by the dendrites of a\\nunipolar sensory neuron, such as the sensory neuron\\nending in the skin, the graded potential is called a\\ngenerator potential because it can directly generate\\nthe action potential in the initial segment of the axon. If\\nthe sensory stimulus is received by a specialized\\nsensory receptor cell, the graded potential is called a\\nreceptor potential. Graded potentials produced by\\ninteractions between neurons at synapses are called\\npostsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A depolarizing graded\\npotential at a synapse is called an excitatory PSP, and a\\nhyperpolarizing graded potential at a synapse is called\\nan inhibitory PSP.\\nSynapses are the contacts between neurons, which\\ncan either be chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical\\nsynapses are far more common. At a chemical synapse,\\nneurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic\\nelement and diffuses across the synaptic cleft. The\\nneurotransmitter binds to a receptor protein and\\ncauses a change in the postsynaptic membrane (the\\nPSP). The neurotransmitter must be inactivated or\\nremoved from the synaptic cleft so that the stimulus is\\nlimited in time.\\nThe particular characteristics of a synapse vary based\\non the neurotransmitter system produced by that\\nneuron. The cholinergic system is found at the\\nneuromuscular junction and in certain places within\\nthe nervous system. Amino acids, such as glutamate,\\nglycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are\\nused as neurotransmitters. Other neurotransmitters\\nare the result of amino acids being enzymatically\\nchanged, as in the biogenic amines, or being covalently\\nbonded together, as in the neuropeptides.\\n12 • Chapter Review 487'),\n",

The structures of the nervous system must be described in detail\\nto understand how many of these functions are possible. There is a physiological concept known as localization of\\nfunction that states that certain structures are specifically responsible for prescribed functions. It is an underlying\\nconcept in all of anatomy and physiology, but the nervous system illustrates the concept very well.\\nFresh, unstained nervous tissue can be described as gray or white matter, and within those two types of tissue it can\\nbe very hard to see any detail. However, as specific regions and structures have been described, they were related\\nto specific functions. Understanding these structures and the functions they perform requires a detailed description\\nof the anatomy of the nervous system, delving deep into what the central and peripheral structures are.\\nThe place to start this study of the nervous system is the beginning of the individual human life, within the womb.\\nThe embryonic development of the nervous system allows for a simple framework on which progressively more\\ncomplicated structures can be built. With this framework in place, a thorough investigation of the nervous system is\\npossible.\\nFigure 13.1 Human Nervous System The ability to balance like an acrobat combines functions throughout the nervous system.

Starting\\nfrom an embryologic perspective allows you to understand more easily how the parts relate to each other. The\\nembryonic nervous system begins as a very simple structure—essentially just a straight line, which then gets\\nincreasingly complex. Looking at the development of the nervous system with a couple of early snapshots makes it\\neasier to understand the whole complex system.\\nMany structures that appear to be adjacent in the adult brain are not connected, and the connections that exist may\\nseem arbitrary. But there is an underlying order to the system that comes from how different parts develop. By\\nfollowing the developmental pattern, it is possible to learn what the major regions of the nervous system are.\\nThe Neural Tube\\nTo begin, a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg cell, or zygote, starts\\ndividing to generate the cells that make up an entire organism. Sixteen days after fertilization, the developing\\nembryo’s cells belong to one of three germ layers that give rise to the different tissues in the body. The endoderm, or\\ninner tissue, is responsible for generating the lining tissues of various spaces within the body, such as the mucosae\\nof the digestive and respiratory systems. The mesoderm, or middle tissue, gives rise to most of the muscle and\\nconnective tissues. Finally the ectoderm, or outer tissue, develops into the integumentary system (the skin) and the\\nnervous system. It is probably not difficult to see that the outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of\\nthe body. But how is it responsible for the nervous system?\\nAs the embryo develops, a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm, which\\nis the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system. Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into\\nthe neuroepithelium, forming a neural plate. The cells then begin to change shape, causing the tissue to buckle and\\nfold inward (Figure 13.2). A neural groove forms, visible as a line along the dorsal surface of the embryo. The ridge-\\nlike edge on either side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold. As the neural folds come together and\\nconverge, the underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called the neural tube. Cells from\\nthe neural folds then separate from the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells referred to as the neural crest, which\\nruns lateral to the neural tube. The neural crest migrates away from the nascent, or embryonic, central nervous\\nsystem (CNS) that will form along the neural groove and develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous\\nsystem (PNS), including the enteric nervous tissue. Many tissues that are not part of the nervous system also arise\\nfrom the neural crest, such as craniofacial cartilage and bone, and melanocytes.\\nFIGURE 13.2 Early Embryonic Development of Nervous System The neuroectoderm begins to fold inward to form the neural groove.\\n494 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The anterior end of the neural\\ntube will develop into the brain, and the posterior portion will become the spinal cord. The neural crest develops into peripheral structures.\\nAt this point, the early nervous system is a simple, hollow tube. It runs from the anterior end of the embryo to the\\nposterior end. Beginning at 25 days, the anterior end develops into the brain, and the posterior portion becomes the\\nspinal cord. This is the most basic arrangement of tissue in the nervous system, and it gives rise to the more\\ncomplex structures by the fourth week of development.\\nPrimary Vesicles\\nAs the anterior end of the neural tube starts to develop into the brain, it undergoes a couple of enlargements; the\\nresult is the production of sac-like vesicles. Similar to a child’s balloon animal, the long, straight neural tube begins\\nto take on a new shape. Three vesicles form at the first stage, which are called primary vesicles. These vesicles are\\ngiven names that are based on Greek words, the main root word being enkephalon, which means “brain” (en- =\\n“inside”; kephalon = “head”). The prefix to each generally corresponds to its position along the length of the\\ndeveloping nervous system.\\nThe prosencephalon (pros- = “in front”) is the forward-most vesicle, and the term can be loosely translated to\\nmean forebrain. The mesencephalon (mes- = “middle”) is the next vesicle, which can be called the midbrain. The\\nthird vesicle at this stage is the rhombencephalon. The first part of this word is also the root of the word rhombus,\\nwhich is a geometrical figure with four sides of equal length (a square is a rhombus with 90° angles). Whereas\\nprosencephalon and mesencephalon translate into the English words forebrain and midbrain, there is not a word for\\n“four-sided-figure-brain.” However, the third vesicle can be called the hindbrain. One way of thinking about how the\\nbrain is arranged is to use these three regions—forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain—which are based on the primary\\nvesicle stage of development (Figure 13.3a).\\nSecondary Vesicles\\nThe brain continues to develop, and the vesicles differentiate further (see Figure 13.3b). The three primary vesicles\\nbecome five secondary vesicles. The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and\\nthe diencephalon. The telecephalon will become the cerebrum. The diencephalon gives rise to several adult\\nstructures; two that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. In the embryonic diencephalon, a\\nstructure known as the eye cup develops, which will eventually become the retina, the nervous tissue of the eye\\ncalled the retina. This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo,\\nbut becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system.\\nThe mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions. The midbrain is an established region of the brain\\nat the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way. The rest of the brain develops around it and\\nconstitutes a large percentage of the mass of the brain. Dividing the brain into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain is\\nuseful in considering its developmental pattern, but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain, relatively\\nspeaking.\\nThe rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The metencephalon corresponds to\\nthe adult structure known as the pons and also gives rise to the cerebellum. The cerebellum (from the Latin meaning\\n“little brain”) accounts for about 10 percent of the mass of the brain and is an important structure in itself. The most\\nsignificant connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain is at the pons, because the pons and\\ncerebellum develop out of the same vesicle. The myelencephalon corresponds to the adult structure known as the\\nmedulla oblongata. The structures that come from the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon, except for the\\ncerebellum, are collectively considered the brain stem, which specifically includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla.\\n13.1 • The Embryologic Perspective 495'),\n",

As the anterior end of the neural tube develops, it enlarges into the primary vesicles that establish the\\nforebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Those structures continue to develop throughout the rest of embryonic\\ndevelopment and into adolescence. They are the basis of the structure of the fully developed adult brain. How would\\nyou describe the difference in the relative sizes of the three regions of the brain when comparing the early (25th\\nembryonic day) brain and the adult brain?\\nSpinal Cord Development\\nWhile the brain is developing from the anterior neural tube, the spinal cord is developing from the posterior neural\\ntube. However, its structure does not differ from the basic layout of the neural tube. It is a long, straight cord with a\\nsmall, hollow space down the center. The neural tube is defined in terms of its anterior versus posterior portions,\\nbut it also has a dorsal–ventral dimension. As the neural tube separates from the rest of the ectoderm, the side\\nclosest to the surface is dorsal, and the deeper side is ventral.\\nAs the spinal cord develops, the cells making up the wall of the neural tube proliferate and differentiate into the\\nneurons and glia of the spinal cord. The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory functions, and the ventral\\ntissues will be associated with motor functions.\\nRelating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain\\nEmbryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the adult brain because it establishes a\\nframework on which more complex structures can be built. First, the neural tube establishes the anterior–posterior\\ndimension of the nervous system, which is called the neuraxis. The embryonic nervous system in mammals can be\\nsaid to have a standard arrangement. Humans (and other primates, to some degree) make this complicated by\\nstanding up and walking on two legs. The anterior–posterior dimension of the neuraxis overlays the\\nsuperior–inferior dimension of the body. However, there is a major curve between the brain stem and forebrain,\\nwhich is called the cephalic flexure. Because of this, the neuraxis starts in an inferior position—the end of the spinal\\ncord—and ends in an anterior position, the front of the cerebrum. If this is confusing, just imagine a four-legged\\nanimal standing up on two legs. Without the flexure in the brain stem, and at the top of the neck, that animal would\\nbe looking straight up instead of straight in front (Figure 13.4).\\n496 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Humans, as two-legged animals, have a bend in the neuraxis between the brain\\nstem and the diencephalon, along with a bend in the neck, so that the eyes and the face are oriented forward.\\nIn summary, the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of the nervous system: forebrain, midbrain, and\\nhindbrain. These divisions are useful in certain situations, but they are not equivalent regions. The midbrain is small\\ncompared with the hindbrain and particularly the forebrain. The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major\\nregions of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text. The telencephalon is the cerebrum, which is\\nthe major portion of the human brain. The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name, because\\nthere is no better term for it (dia- = “through”). The diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the\\nnervous system and can be described as the region through which all projections have to pass between the\\ncerebrum and everything else. The brain stem includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla, which correspond to the\\nmesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon. The cerebellum, being a large portion of the brain, is\\nconsidered a separate region. Table 13.1 connects the different stages of development to the adult structures of the\\nCNS.\\nOne other benefit of considering embryonic development is that certain connections are more obvious because of\\nhow these adult structures are related. The retina, which began as part of the diencephalon, is primarily connected\\nto the diencephalon. The eyes are just inferior to the anterior-most part of the cerebrum, but the optic nerve extends\\nback to the thalamus as the optic tract, with branches into a region of the hypothalamus. There is also a connection\\nof the optic tract to the midbrain, but the mesencephalon is adjacent to the diencephalon, so that is not difficult to\\nimagine. The cerebellum originates out of the metencephalon, and its largest white matter connection is to the pons,\\nalso from the metencephalon. There are connections between the cerebellum and both the medulla and midbrain,\\nwhich are adjacent structures in the secondary vesicle stage of development. In the adult brain, the cerebellum\\nseems close to the cerebrum, but there is no direct connection between them.\\nAnother aspect of the adult CNS structures that relates to embryonic development is the ventricles—open spaces\\nwithin the CNS where cerebrospinal fluid circulates. They are the remnant of the hollow center of the neural tube.\\nThe four ventricles and the tubular spaces associated with them can be linked back to the hollow center of the\\nembryonic brain (see Table 13.1).\\n13.1 • The Embryologic Perspective 497'),\n",

A groove forms along the\\ndorsal surface of the embryo, which becomes deeper until its edges meet and close off to form the tube. If this\\nfails to happen, especially in the posterior region where the spinal cord forms, a developmental defect called\\nspina bifida occurs. The closing of the neural tube is important for more than just the proper formation of the\\nnervous system. The surrounding tissues are dependent on the correct development of the tube. The connective\\ntissues surrounding the CNS can be involved as well.\\nThere are three classes of this disorder: occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele (Figure 13.5). The first\\ntype, spina bifida occulta, is the mildest because the vertebral bones do not fully surround the spinal cord, but\\nthe spinal cord itself is not affected. No functional differences may be noticed, which is what the word occulta\\nmeans; it is hidden spina bifida. The other two types both involve the formation of a cyst—a fluid-filled sac of the\\nconnective tissues that cover the spinal cord called the meninges. “Meningocele” means that the meninges\\nprotrude through the spinal column but nerves may not be involved and few symptoms are present, though\\ncomplications may arise later in life. “Myelomeningocele” means that the meninges protrude and spinal nerves\\nare involved, and therefore severe neurological symptoms can be present.\\nOften surgery to close the opening or to remove the cyst is necessary. The earlier that surgery can be performed,\\nthe better the chances of controlling or limiting further damage or infection at the opening. For many children\\nwith meningocele, surgery will alleviate the pain, although they may experience some functional loss. Because\\nthe myelomeningocele form of spina bifida involves more extensive damage to the nervous tissue, neurological\\ndamage may persist, but symptoms can often be handled. Complications of the spinal cord may present later in\\nlife, but overall life expectancy is not reduced.\\n498 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The spinal cord is a single structure, whereas the adult brain is described in terms of four major regions: the\\ncerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. A person’s conscious experiences are based on\\nneural activity in the brain. The regulation of homeostasis is governed by a specialized region in the brain. The\\ncoordination of reflexes depends on the integration of sensory and motor pathways in the spinal cord.\\nFIGURE 13.5 Spinal Bifida (a) Spina bifida is a birth defect of the spinal cord caused when the neural tube does not completely\\nclose, but the rest of development continues.

The wrinkled portion is the cerebral cortex, and the rest of the structure is beneath that\\nouter covering. There is a large separation between the two sides of the cerebrum called the longitudinal fissure. It\\nseparates the cerebrum into two distinct halves, a right and left cerebral hemisphere. Deep within the cerebrum,\\nthe white matter of the corpus callosum provides the major pathway for communication between the two\\nhemispheres of the cerebral cortex.\\nFIGURE 13.6 The Cerebrum The cerebrum is a large component of the CNS in humans, and the most obvious aspect of it is the folded\\nsurface called the cerebral cortex.\\nMany of the higher neurological functions, such as memory, emotion, and consciousness, are the result of cerebral\\nfunction. The complexity of the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species. The cerebrum of the most primitive\\nvertebrates is not much more than the connection for the sense of smell. In mammals, the cerebrum comprises the\\nouter gray matter that is the cortex (from the Latin word meaning “bark of a tree”) and several deep nuclei that\\nbelong to three important functional groups. The basal nuclei are responsible for cognitive processing, the most\\nimportant function being that associated with planning movements. The basal forebrain contains nuclei that are\\nimportant in learning and memory. The limbic cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex that is part of the limbic\\nsystem, a collection of structures involved in emotion, memory, and behavior.\\nCerebral Cortex\\nThe cerebrum is covered by a continuous layer of gray matter that wraps around either side of the forebrain—the\\ncerebral cortex. This thin, extensive region of wrinkled gray matter is responsible for the higher functions of the\\nnervous system. A gyrus (plural = gyri) is the ridge of one of those wrinkles, and a sulcus (plural = sulci) is the\\ngroove between two gyri. The pattern of these folds of tissue indicates specific regions of the cerebral cortex.\\nThe head is limited by the size of the birth canal, and the brain must fit inside the cranial cavity of the skull.\\nExtensive folding in the cerebral cortex enables more gray matter to fit into this limited space. If the gray matter of\\nthe cortex were peeled off of the cerebrum and laid out flat, its surface area would be roughly equal to one square\\nmeter.\\nThe folding of the cortex maximizes the amount of gray matter in the cranial cavity. During embryonic development,\\nas the telencephalon expands within the skull, the brain goes through a regular course of growth that results in\\neveryone’s brain having a similar pattern of folds. The surface of the brain can be mapped on the basis of the\\nlocations of large gyri and sulci. Using these landmarks, the cortex can be separated into four major regions, or lobes\\n(Figure 13.7). The lateral sulcus that separates the temporal lobe from the other regions is one such landmark.\\nSuperior to the lateral sulcus are the parietal lobe and frontal lobe, which are separated from each other by the\\ncentral sulcus. The posterior region of the cortex is the occipital lobe, which has no obvious anatomical border\\nbetween it and the parietal or temporal lobes on the lateral surface of the brain.

Extensive folding increases the surface area\\navailable for cerebral functions.\\nDifferent regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions, a concept known as localization\\nof function. In the early 1900s, a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study\\nof the microscopic anatomy—the cytoarchitecture—of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52 separate\\nregions on the basis of the histology of the cortex. His work resulted in a system of classification known as\\nBrodmann’s areas, which is still used today to describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex (Figure 13.8).\\nThe results from Brodmann’s work on the anatomy align very well with the functional differences within the cortex.\\nAreas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are responsible for primary visual perception. That visual information is\\ncomplex, so it is processed in the temporal and parietal lobes as well.\\nThe temporal lobe is associated with primary auditory sensation, known as Brodmann’s areas 41 and 42 in the\\nsuperior temporal lobe. Because regions of the temporal lobe are part of the limbic system, memory is an important\\nfunction associated with that lobe. Memory is essentially a sensory function; memories are recalled sensations such\\nas the smell of Mom’s baking or the sound of a barking dog. Even memories of movement are really the memory of\\nsensory feedback from those movements, such as stretching muscles or the movement of the skin around a joint.\\nStructures in the temporal lobe are responsible for establishing long-term memory, but the ultimate location of\\nthose memories is usually in the region in which the sensory perception was processed.\\nThe main sensation associated with the parietal lobe is somatosensation, meaning the general sensations\\nassociated with the body. Posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus, the primary somatosensory\\ncortex, which is identified as Brodmann’s areas 1, 2, and 3. All of the tactile senses are processed in this area,\\nincluding touch, pressure, tickle, pain, itch, and vibration, as well as more general senses of the body such as\\nproprioception and kinesthesia, which are the senses of body position and movement, respectively.\\nAnterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, which is primarily associated with motor functions. The precentral\\ngyrus is the primary motor cortex. Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that\\ninstruct cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles. Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated\\nwith planned movements. The premotor area is responsible for thinking of a movement to be made. The frontal eye\\nfields are important in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli. Broca’s area is responsible for the\\nproduction of language, or controlling movements responsible for speech; in the vast majority of people, it is located\\nonly on the left side.

The\\nnuclei of the basal forebrain serve as the primary location for acetylcholine production, which modulates the overall\\nactivity of the cortex, possibly leading to greater attention to sensory stimuli. Alzheimer’s disease is associated with\\na loss of neurons in the basal forebrain. The hippocampus and amygdala are medial-lobe structures that, along\\nwith the adjacent cortex, are involved in long-term memory formation and emotional responses. The basal nuclei\\nare a set of nuclei in the cerebrum responsible for comparing cortical processing with the general state of activity in\\nthe nervous system to influence the likelihood of movement taking place. For example, while a student is sitting in a\\nclassroom listening to a lecture, the basal nuclei will keep the urge to jump up and scream from actually happening.\\n(The basal nuclei are also referred to as the basal ganglia, although that is potentially confusing because the term\\nganglia is typically used for peripheral structures.)\\nThe major structures of the basal nuclei that control movement are the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus,\\nwhich are located deep in the cerebrum. The caudate is a long nucleus that follows the basic C-shape of the\\ncerebrum from the frontal lobe, through the parietal and occipital lobes, into the temporal lobe. The putamen is\\nmostly deep in the anterior regions of the frontal and parietal lobes. Together, the caudate and putamen are called\\nthe striatum. The globus pallidus is a layered nucleus that lies just medial to the putamen; they are called the\\nlenticular nuclei because they look like curved pieces fitting together like lenses. The globus pallidus has two\\nsubdivisions, the external and internal segments, which are lateral and medial, respectively. These nuclei are\\ndepicted in a frontal section of the brain in Figure 13.9.\\n502 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

Two streams of information processing take place in the basal nuclei.\\nAll input to the basal nuclei is from the cortex into the striatum (Figure 13.10). The direct pathway is the projection\\nof axons from the striatum to the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata\\n(SNr).

The two streams both target the GPi/SNr, but one has a direct projection and\\nthe other goes through a few intervening nuclei. The direct pathway causes the disinhibition of the thalamus\\n(inhibition of one cell on a target cell that then inhibits the first cell), whereas the indirect pathway causes, or\\nreinforces, the normal inhibition of the thalamus.

Many pervasive functions, such as language, are distributed globally around the\\ncerebrum.\\nSome of the support for this misconception has come from studies of split brains. A drastic way to deal with a\\nrare and devastating neurological condition (intractable epilepsy) is to separate the two hemispheres of the\\nbrain. After sectioning the corpus callosum, a split-brained patient will have trouble producing verbal responses\\non the basis of sensory information processed on the right side of the cerebrum, leading to the idea that the left\\nside is responsible for language function.\\nHowever, there are well-documented cases of language functions lost from damage to the right side of the brain.\\nThe deficits seen in damage to the left side of the brain are classified as aphasia, a loss of speech function;\\ndamage on the right side can affect the use of language. Right-side damage can result in a loss of ability to\\nunderstand figurative aspects of speech, such as jokes, irony, or metaphors. Nonverbal aspects of speech can be\\naffected by damage to the right side, such as facial expression or body language, and right-side damage can lead\\nto a “flat affect” in speech, or a loss of emotional expression in speech—sounding like a robot when talking.\\n504 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Whereas the brain develops out of expansions of the neural tube into primary and then secondary\\nvesicles, the spinal cord maintains the tube structure and is only specialized into certain regions. As the spinal cord\\ncontinues to develop in the newborn, anatomical features mark its surface. The anterior midline is marked by the\\nanterior median fissure, and the posterior midline is marked by the posterior median sulcus. Axons enter the\\nposterior side through the dorsal (posterior) nerve root, which marks the posterolateral sulcus on either side. The\\naxons emerging from the anterior side do so through the ventral (anterior) nerve root. Note that it is common to\\nsee the terms dorsal (dorsal = “back”) and ventral (ventral = “belly”) used interchangeably with posterior and\\nanterior, particularly in reference to nerves and the structures of the spinal cord. You should learn to be comfortable\\nwith both.\\nOn the whole, the posterior regions are responsible for sensory functions and the anterior regions are associated\\nwith motor functions. This comes from the initial development of the spinal cord, which is divided into the basal\\nplate and the alar plate. The basal plate is closest to the ventral midline of the neural tube, which will become the\\nanterior face of the spinal cord and gives rise to motor neurons. The alar plate is on the dorsal side of the neural\\ntube and gives rise to neurons that will receive sensory input from the periphery.\\nThe length of the spinal cord is divided into regions that correspond to the regions of the vertebral column. The\\nname of a spinal cord region corresponds to the level at which spinal nerves pass through the intervertebral\\nforamina. Immediately adjacent to the brain stem is the cervical region, followed by the thoracic, then the lumbar,\\nand finally the sacral region. The spinal cord is not the full length of the vertebral column because the spinal cord\\ndoes not grow significantly longer after the first or second year, but the skeleton continues to grow. The nerves that\\nemerge from the spinal cord pass through the intervertebral foramina at the respective levels. As the vertebral\\ncolumn grows, these nerves grow with it and result in a long bundle of nerves that resembles a horse’s tail and is\\nnamed the cauda equina. The sacral spinal cord is at the level of the upper lumbar vertebral bones. The spinal\\nnerves extend from their various levels to the proper level of the vertebral column.\\nGray Horns\\nIn cross-section, the gray matter of the spinal cord has the appearance of an ink-blot test, with the spread of the\\ngray matter on one side replicated on the other—a shape reminiscent of a bulbous capital “H.” As shown in Figure\\n13.14, the gray matter is subdivided into regions that are referred to as horns. The posterior horn is responsible for\\nsensory processing. The anterior horn sends out motor signals to the skeletal muscles. The lateral horn, which is\\nonly found in the thoracic, upper lumbar, and sacral regions, contains cell bodies of motor neurons of the autonomic\\nnervous system.\\nSome of the largest neurons of the spinal cord are the multipolar motor neurons in the anterior horn.

The CNS has a privileged blood supply, as suggested by the blood-brain barrier. The function of the\\ntissue in the CNS is crucial to the survival of the organism, so the contents of the blood cannot simply pass into the\\ncentral nervous tissue. To protect this region from the toxins and pathogens that may be traveling through the blood\\nstream, there is strict control over what can move out of the general systems and into the brain and spinal cord.\\nBecause of this privilege, the CNS needs specialized structures for the maintenance of circulation. This begins with a\\nunique arrangement of blood vessels carrying fresh blood into the CNS. Beyond the supply of blood, the CNS filters\\nthat blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is then circulated through the cavities of the brain and spinal cord\\ncalled ventricles.\\nBlood Supply to the Brain\\nA lack of oxygen to the CNS can be devastating, and the cardiovascular system has specific regulatory reflexes to\\nensure that the blood supply is not interrupted. There are multiple routes for blood to get into the CNS, with\\nspecializations to protect that blood supply and to maximize the ability of the brain to get an uninterrupted\\nperfusion.\\neffects of the direct and indirect pathways. Parkinson’s disease is the result of neurons in the substantia nigra\\npars compacta dying. These neurons release dopamine into the striatum. Without that modulatory influence, the\\nbasal nuclei are stuck in the indirect pathway, without the direct pathway being activated. The direct pathway is\\nresponsible for increasing cortical movement commands. The increased activity of the indirect pathway results\\nin the hypokinetic disorder of Parkinson’s disease.\\nParkinson’s disease is neurodegenerative, meaning that neurons die that cannot be replaced, so there is no cure\\nfor the disorder. Treatments for Parkinson’s disease are aimed at increasing dopamine levels in the striatum.\\nCurrently, the most common way of doing that is by providing the amino acid L-DOPA, which is a precursor to the\\nneurotransmitter dopamine and can cross the blood-brain barrier. With levels of the precursor elevated, the\\nremaining cells of the substantia nigra pars compacta can make more neurotransmitter and have a greater\\neffect. Unfortunately, the patient will become less responsive to L-DOPA treatment as time progresses, and it\\ncan cause increased dopamine levels elsewhere in the brain, which are associated with psychosis or\\nschizophrenia.\\n13.3 • Circulation and the Central Nervous System 511'),\n",

The external carotid arteries supply blood to the tissues on\\nthe surface of the cranium. The bases of the common carotids contain stretch receptors that immediately respond\\nto the drop in blood pressure upon standing. The orthostatic reflex is a reaction to this change in body position, so\\nthat blood pressure is maintained against the increasing effect of gravity (orthostatic means “standing up”).

A second set of\\nvessels that supply the CNS are the vertebral arteries, which are protected as they pass through the neck region by\\nthe transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae.

The name pia mater comes from the Latin for\\n“tender mother,” suggesting the thin membrane is a gentle covering for the brain. The pia extends into every\\nconvolution of the CNS, lining the inside of the sulci in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. At the end of the spinal\\ncord, a thin filament extends from the inferior end of CNS at the upper lumbar region of the vertebral column to the\\nsacral end of the vertebral column.

Because of the anatomy of the CNS, it is a relative safe\\nlocation to insert a needle. Why is the lumbar puncture performed in the lower lumbar area of the vertebral column?\\nThe Ventricular System\\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates throughout and around the CNS. In other tissues, water and small molecules are\\nfiltered through capillaries as the major contributor to the interstitial fluid. In the brain, CSF is produced in special\\nstructures to perfuse through the nervous tissue of the CNS and is continuous with the interstitial fluid. Specifically,\\nCSF circulates to remove metabolic wastes from the interstitial fluids of nervous tissues and return them to the\\nblood stream. The ventricles are the open spaces within the brain where CSF circulates. In some of these spaces,\\nCSF is produced by filtering of the blood that is performed by a specialized membrane known as a choroid plexus.\\nThe CSF circulates through all of the ventricles to eventually emerge into the subarachnoid space where it will be\\nreabsorbed into the blood.\\nThe Ventricles\\nThere are four ventricles within the brain, all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural\\ntube, the central canal. The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum. These\\nventricles are connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina. The third\\nventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon, which opens into the cerebral aqueduct\\nthat passes through the midbrain. The aqueduct opens into the fourth ventricle, which is the space between the\\ncerebellum and the pons and upper medulla (Figure 13.18).\\nDisorders of the...\\nMeninges\\nMeningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the three layers of fibrous membrane that surround the CNS.\\nMeningitis can be caused by infection by bacteria or viruses. The particular pathogens are not special to\\nmeningitis; it is just an inflammation of that specific set of tissues from what might be a broader infection.\\nBacterial meningitis can be caused by Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, or the tuberculosis pathogen, among\\nmany others. Viral meningitis is usually the result of common enteroviruses (such as those that cause intestinal\\ndisorders), but may be the result of the herpes virus or West Nile virus. Bacterial meningitis tends to be more\\nsevere.\\nThe symptoms associated with meningitis can be fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, soreness of the\\nneck, or severe headache. More important are the neurological symptoms, such as changes in mental state\\n(confusion, memory deficits, and other dementia-type symptoms). A serious risk of meningitis can be damage to\\nperipheral structures because of the nerves that pass through the meninges. Hearing loss is a common result of\\nmeningitis.\\nThe primary test for meningitis is a lumbar puncture. A needle inserted into the lumbar region of the spinal\\ncolumn through the dura mater and arachnoid membrane into the subarachnoid space can be used to withdraw\\nthe fluid for chemical testing. Fatality occurs in 5 to 40 percent of children and 20 to 50 percent of adults with\\nbacterial meningitis. Treatment of bacterial meningitis is through antibiotics, but viral meningitis cannot be\\ntreated with antibiotics because viruses do not respond to that type of drug. Fortunately, the viral forms are\\nmilder.\\n13.3 • Circulation and the Central Nervous System 515'),\n",

Many\\nof the neural structures that are incorporated into other organs are features of the digestive system; these\\nstructures are known as the enteric nervous system and are a special subset of the PNS.\\nGanglia\\nA ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia can be categorized, for the most part, as either\\nsensory ganglia or autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common type of sensory\\nganglion is a dorsal (posterior) root ganglion. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with axons that are\\nsensory endings in the periphery, such as in the skin, and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root.\\nThe ganglion is an enlargement of the nerve root. Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell\\nbodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers that are the posterior nerve root (Figure 13.19). The cells of the\\ndorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them by shape. Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can\\nbe seen surrounding—as if they were orbiting—the neuron cell bodies.\\nSevere or limited memory loss can be the result of a temporal lobe stroke.\\nRelated to strokes are transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which can also be called “mini-strokes.” These are\\nevents in which a physical blockage may be temporary, cutting off the blood supply and oxygen to a region, but\\nnot to the extent that it causes cell death in that region. While the neurons in that area are recovering from the\\nevent, neurological function may be lost. Function can return if the area is able to recover from the event.\\nRecovery from a stroke (or TIA) is strongly dependent on the speed of treatment. Often, the person who is\\npresent and notices something is wrong must then make a decision. The mnemonic FAST helps people\\nremember what to look for when someone is dealing with sudden losses of neurological function. If someone\\ncomplains of feeling “funny,” check these things quickly: Look at the person’s face. Do they have problems\\nmoving Face muscles and making regular facial expressions? Ask the person to raise their Arms above the head.\\nCan the person lift one arm but not the other? Has the person’s Speech changed? Are they slurring words or\\nhaving trouble saying things? If any of these things have happened, then it is Time to call for help.\\nSometimes, treatment with blood-thinning drugs can alleviate the problem, and recovery is possible. If the\\ntissue is damaged, the amazing thing about the nervous system is that it is adaptable. With physical,\\noccupational, and speech therapy, victims of strokes can recover, or more accurately relearn, functions.\\n518 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The sympathetic chain ganglia constitute a row of ganglia\\nalong the vertebral column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal\\ncord. Superior to the chain ganglia are three paravertebral ganglia in the cervical region. Three other autonomic\\nganglia that are related to the sympathetic chain are the prevertebral ganglia, which are located outside of the\\nchain but have similar functions. They are referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral\\ncolumn. The neurons of these autonomic ganglia are multipolar in shape, with dendrites radiating out around the\\ncell body where synapses from the spinal cord neurons are made. The neurons of the chain, paravertebral, and\\nprevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the head and neck, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities to regulate\\nthe sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms.\\nAnother group of autonomic ganglia are the terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves or sacral spinal\\nnerves and are responsible for regulating the parasympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms. These two sets\\nof ganglia, sympathetic and parasympathetic, often project to the same organs—one input from the chain ganglia\\nand one input from a terminal ganglion—to regulate the overall function of an organ. For example, the heart receives\\ntwo inputs such as these; one increases heart rate, and the other decreases it. The terminal ganglia that receive\\ninput from cranial nerves are found in the head and neck, as well as the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities,\\nwhereas the terminal ganglia that receive sacral input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities.\\nTerminal ganglia below the head and neck are often incorporated into the wall of the target organ as a plexus. A\\nplexus, in a general sense, is a network of fibers or vessels. This can apply to nervous tissue (as in this instance) or\\nstructures containing blood vessels (such as a choroid plexus). For example, the enteric plexus is the extensive\\nnetwork of axons and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines. The enteric plexus is actually part of the\\nenteric nervous system, along with the gastric plexuses and the esophageal plexus. Though the enteric nervous\\nsystem receives input originating from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system, it does not require CNS\\ninput to function. In fact, it operates independently to regulate the digestive system.\\nNerves\\nBundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves. These structures in the periphery are different than the\\ncentral counterpart, called a tract. Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue. They have connective\\ntissues invested in their structure, as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment. The outer\\nsurface of a nerve is a surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium. Within the nerve, axons\\nare further bundled into fascicles, which are each surrounded by their own layer of fibrous connective tissue called\\nperineurium. Finally, individual axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the endoneurium (Figure\\n13.21). These three layers are similar to the connective tissue sheaths for muscles. Nerves are associated with the\\nregion of the CNS to which they are connected, either as cranial nerves connected to the brain or spinal nerves\\nconnected to the spinal cord.\\n520 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for\\n“Cranial Nerve,” using Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or\\na combination of both, meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the\\ncranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons\\nconnect to skeletal muscles of the head or neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are\\nstrictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed nerves.\\nLearning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to\\nremember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, “On Old Olympus’ Towering Tops/A Finn\\nAnd German Viewed Some Hops,” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name\\nof each nerve. The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate\\nnaming. An exercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal\\nsignificance. The names of the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function,\\ntheir source (sensory ganglion or motor nucleus), and their target (sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle). They are\\nlisted here with a brief explanation of each nerve (Figure 13.23).\\nThe olfactory nerve and optic nerve are responsible for the sense of smell and vision, respectively. The oculomotor\\nnerve is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles. It is also responsible for\\nlifting the upper eyelid when the eyes point up, and for pupillary constriction. The trochlear nerve and the\\nabducens nerve are both responsible for eye movement, but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles. The\\ntrigeminal nerve is responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face and controlling the muscles of mastication.\\nThe facial nerve is responsible for the muscles involved in facial expressions, as well as part of the sense of taste\\nand the production of saliva. The vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance. The\\nglossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat, as well as part of\\nthe sense of taste and the production of saliva. The vagus nerve is responsible for contributing to homeostatic\\ncontrol of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities. The spinal accessory nerve is responsible for\\ncontrolling the muscles of the neck, along with cervical spinal nerves. The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for\\ncontrolling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue.\\n522 13 • Anatomy of the Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The oculomotor, facial, and glossopharyngeal nerves contain fibers that contact autonomic\\nganglia. The oculomotor fibers initiate pupillary constriction, whereas the facial and glossopharyngeal fibers both\\ninitiate salivation. The vagus nerve primarily targets autonomic ganglia in the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/NYTmeningitis) to read about a man who wakes with a headache and a loss of\\nvision. His regular doctor sent him to an ophthalmologist to address the vision loss. The ophthalmologist recognizes\\na greater problem and immediately sends him to the emergency room. Once there, the patient undergoes a large\\nbattery of tests, but a definite cause cannot be found. A specialist recognizes the problem as meningitis, but the\\nquestion is what caused it originally. How can that be cured? The loss of vision comes from swelling around the optic\\nnerve, which probably presented as a bulge on the inside of the eye. Why is swelling related to meningitis going to\\npush on the optic nerve?\\nAnother important aspect of the cranial nerves that lends itself to a mnemonic is the functional role each nerve\\nplays. The nerves fall into one of three basic groups. They are sensory, motor, or both (see Table 13.3). The\\nsentence, “Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Brains Beauty Matter More,” corresponds to the basic\\nfunction of each nerve. The first, second, and eighth nerves are purely sensory: the olfactory (CNI), optic (CNII), and\\nvestibulocochlear (CNVIII) nerves. The three eye-movement nerves are all motor: the oculomotor (CNIII), trochlear\\n(CNIV), and abducens (CNVI). The spinal accessory (CNXI) and hypoglossal (CNXII) nerves are also strictly motor.\\nThe remainder of the nerves contain both sensory and motor fibers. They are the trigeminal (CNV), facial (CNVII),\\nglossopharyngeal (CNIX), and vagus (CNX) nerves. The nerves that convey both are often related to each other. The\\ntrigeminal and facial nerves both concern the face; one concerns the sensations and the other concerns the muscle\\nmovements. The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are both responsible for conveying gustatory, or taste,\\nsensations as well as controlling salivary glands. The vagus nerve is involved in visceral responses to taste, namely\\nthe gag reflex. This is not an exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do, but there is a thread of relation\\nbetween them.\\n13.4 • The Peripheral Nervous System 523'),\n",

The arrangement of these nerves is much more\\nregular than that of the cranial nerves. All of the spinal nerves are combined sensory and motor axons that separate\\ninto two nerve roots. The sensory axons enter the spinal cord as the dorsal nerve root. The motor fibers, both\\nsomatic and autonomic, emerge as the ventral nerve root. The dorsal root ganglion for each nerve is an enlargement\\nof the spinal nerve.\\nThere are 31 spinal nerves, named for the level of the spinal cord at which each one emerges. There are eight pairs\\nof cervical nerves designated C1 to C8, twelve thoracic nerves designated T1 to T12, five pairs of lumbar nerves\\ndesignated L1 to L5, five pairs of sacral nerves designated S1 to S5, and one pair of coccygeal nerves. The nerves\\nare numbered from the superior to inferior positions, and each emerges from the vertebral column through the\\nintervertebral foramen at its level. The first nerve, C1, emerges between the first cervical vertebra and the occipital\\nbone. The second nerve, C2, emerges between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The same occurs for C3 to\\nC7, but C8 emerges between the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra. For the thoracic and\\nlumbar nerves, each one emerges between the vertebra that has the same designation and the next vertebra in the\\ncolumn. The sacral nerves emerge from the sacral foramina along the length of that unique vertebra.\\nSpinal nerves extend outward from the vertebral column to innervate the periphery. The nerves in the periphery are\\nnot straight continuations of the spinal nerves, but rather the reorganization of the axons in those nerves to follow\\ndifferent courses. Axons from different spinal nerves will come together into a systemic nerve. This occurs at four\\nplaces along the length of the vertebral column, each identified as a nerve plexus, whereas the other spinal nerves\\ndirectly correspond to nerves at their respective levels. In this instance, the word plexus is used to describe\\nnetworks of nerve fibers with no associated cell bodies.\\nOf the four nerve plexuses, two are found at the cervical level, one at the lumbar level, and one at the sacral level\\n(Figure 13.24). The cervical plexus is composed of axons from spinal nerves C1 through C5 and branches into\\nnerves in the posterior neck and head, as well as the phrenic nerve, which connects to the diaphragm at the base of\\nthe thoracic cavity. The other plexus from the cervical level is the brachial plexus. Spinal nerves C4 through T1\\nreorganize through this plexus to give rise to the nerves of the arms, as the name brachial suggests. A large nerve\\nfrom this plexus is the radial nerve from which the axillary nerve branches to go to the armpit region. The radial\\nnerve continues through the arm and is paralleled by the ulnar nerve and the median nerve. The lumbar plexus\\narises from all the lumbar spinal nerves and gives rise to nerves enervating the pelvic region and the anterior leg.\\nThe femoral nerve is one of the major nerves from this plexus, which gives rise to the saphenous nerve as a branch\\nthat extends through the anterior lower leg. The sacral plexus comes from the lower lumbar nerves L4 and L5 and\\nthe sacral nerves S1 to S4. The most significant systemic nerve to come from this plexus is the sciatic nerve, which\\nis a combination of the tibial nerve and the fibular nerve. The sciatic nerve extends across the hip joint and is most\\ncommonly associated with the condition sciatica, which is the result of compression or irritation of the nerve or any\\nof the spinal nerves giving rise to it.\\nThese plexuses are described as arising from spinal nerves and giving rise to certain systemic nerves, but they\\ncontain fibers that serve sensory functions or fibers that serve motor functions. This means that some fibers extend\\nfrom cutaneous or other peripheral sensory surfaces and send action potentials into the CNS. Those are axons of\\n13.4 • The Peripheral Nervous System 525'),\n",

It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed, usually\\nbecause of blunt force trauma to the head. The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited\\nlifespan of approximately one to four months, and new ones are made on a regular basis. The new neurons\\nextend their axons into the CNS by growing along the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve. The ability of these\\nneurons to be replaced is lost with age. Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head, but\\nrather a slow loss of the sensory neurons with no new neurons born to replace them.\\nSmell is an important sense, especially for the enjoyment of food. There are only five tastes sensed by the\\ntongue, and two of them are generally thought of as unpleasant tastes (sour and bitter). The rich sensory\\nexperience of food is the result of odor molecules associated with the food, both as food is moved into the\\nmouth, and therefore passes under the nose, and when it is chewed and molecules are released to move up the\\npharynx into the posterior nasal cavity. Anosmia results in a loss of the enjoyment of food.\\nAs the replacement of olfactory neurons declines with age, anosmia can set in. Without the sense of smell, many\\nsufferers complain of food tasting bland. Often, the only way to enjoy food is to add seasoning that can be\\nsensed on the tongue, which usually means adding table salt. The problem with this solution, however, is that\\nthis increases sodium intake, which can lead to cardiovascular problems through water retention and the\\nassociated increase in blood pressure.\\n13.4 • The Peripheral Nervous System 527'),\n",

The outer layer of the\\nembryo, the ectoderm, gives rise to the skin and the\\nnervous system. A specialized region of this layer, the\\nneuroectoderm, becomes a groove that folds in and\\nbecomes the neural tube beneath the dorsal surface of\\nthe embryo. The anterior end of the neural tube\\ndevelops into the brain, and the posterior region\\nbecomes the spinal cord. Tissues at the edges of the\\nneural groove, when it closes off, are called the neural\\ncrest and migrate through the embryo to give rise to\\nPNS structures as well as some non-nervous tissues.\\nThe brain develops from this early tube structure and\\ngives rise to specific regions of the adult brain. As the\\nneural tube grows and differentiates, it enlarges into\\nthree vesicles that correspond to the forebrain,\\nmidbrain, and hindbrain regions of the adult brain.\\nLater in development, two of these three vesicles\\ndifferentiate further, resulting in five vesicles. Those\\nfive vesicles can be aligned with the four major regions\\nof the adult brain. The cerebrum is formed directly\\nfrom the telencephalon. The diencephalon is the only\\nregion that keeps its embryonic name. The\\n532 13 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The rest of\\nthe hollow center of the neural tube corresponds to\\nopen spaces within the brain called the ventricles,\\nwhere cerebrospinal fluid is found.\\n13.2 The Central Nervous System\\nThe adult brain is separated into four major regions:\\nthe cerebrum, the diencephalon, the brain stem, and\\nthe cerebellum. The cerebrum is the largest portion\\nand contains the cerebral cortex and subcortical nuclei.\\nIt is divided into two halves by the longitudinal fissure.\\nThe cortex is separated into the frontal, parietal,\\ntemporal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is\\nresponsible for motor functions, from planning\\nmovements through executing commands to be sent to\\nthe spinal cord and periphery. The most anterior\\nportion of the frontal lobe is the prefrontal cortex,\\nwhich is associated with aspects of personality through\\nits influence on motor responses in decision-making.\\nThe other lobes are responsible for sensory functions.\\nThe parietal lobe is where somatosensation is\\nprocessed. The occipital lobe is where visual\\nprocessing begins, although the other parts of the brain\\ncan contribute to visual function. The temporal lobe\\ncontains the cortical area for auditory processing, but\\nalso has regions crucial for memory formation.\\nNuclei beneath the cerebral cortex, known as the\\nsubcortical nuclei, are responsible for augmenting\\ncortical functions. The basal nuclei receive input from\\ncortical areas and compare it with the general state of\\nthe individual through the activity of a dopamine-\\nreleasing nucleus. The output influences the activity of\\npart of the thalamus that can then increase or decrease\\ncortical activity that often results in changes to motor\\ncommands. The basal forebrain is responsible for\\nmodulating cortical activity in attention and memory.\\nThe limbic system includes deep cerebral nuclei that\\nare responsible for emotion and memory.\\nThe diencephalon includes the thalamus and the\\nhypothalamus, along with some other structures. The\\nthalamus is a relay between the cerebrum and the rest\\nof the nervous system. The hypothalamus coordinates\\nhomeostatic functions through the autonomic and\\nendocrine systems.\\nThe brain stem is composed of the midbrain, pons, and\\nmedulla. It controls the head and neck region of the\\nbody through the cranial nerves. There are control\\ncenters in the brain stem that regulate the\\ncardiovascular and respiratory systems.\\nThe cerebellum is connected to the brain stem,\\nprimarily at the pons, where it receives a copy of the\\ndescending input from the cerebrum to the spinal cord.\\nIt can compare this with sensory feedback input\\nthrough the medulla and send output through the\\nmidbrain that can correct motor commands for\\ncoordination.\\n13.3 Circulation and the Central Nervous\\nSystem\\nThe CNS has a privileged blood supply established by\\nthe blood-brain barrier. Establishing this barrier are\\nanatomical structures that help to protect and isolate\\nthe CNS. The arterial blood to the brain comes from the\\ninternal carotid and vertebral arteries, which both\\ncontribute to the unique circle of Willis that provides\\nconstant perfusion of the brain even if one of the blood\\nvessels is blocked or narrowed. That blood is\\neventually filtered to make a separate medium, the\\nCSF, that circulates within the spaces of the brain and\\nthen into the surrounding space defined by the\\nmeninges, the protective covering of the brain and\\nspinal cord.\\nThe blood that nourishes the brain and spinal cord is\\nbehind the glial-cell–enforced blood-brain barrier,\\nwhich limits the exchange of material from blood\\nvessels with the interstitial fluid of the nervous tissue.\\nThus, metabolic wastes are collected in cerebrospinal\\nfluid that circulates through the CNS. This fluid is\\nproduced by filtering blood at the choroid plexuses in\\nthe four ventricles of the brain. It then circulates\\nthrough the ventricles and into the subarachnoid\\nspace, between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater.\\nFrom the arachnoid granulations, CSF is reabsorbed\\ninto the blood, removing the waste from the privileged\\ncentral nervous tissue.\\nThe blood, now with the reabsorbed CSF, drains out of\\nthe cranium through the dural sinuses. The dura mater\\nis the tough outer covering of the CNS, which is\\nanchored to the inner surface of the cranial and\\nvertebral cavities. It surrounds the venous space\\nknown as the dural sinuses, which connect to the\\njugular veins, where blood drains from the head and\\nneck.\\n13.4 The Peripheral Nervous System\\nThe PNS is composed of the groups of neurons\\n13 • Chapter Review 533'),\n",

However, this misses an important point: somatic refers to a functional division, whereas peripheral refers\\nto an anatomic division. The somatic nervous system is responsible for our conscious perception of the environment\\nand for our voluntary responses to that perception by means of skeletal muscles. Peripheral sensory neurons\\nreceive input from environmental stimuli, but the neurons that produce motor responses originate in the central\\nnervous system. The distinction between the structures (i.e., anatomy) of the peripheral and central nervous\\nsystems and functions (i.e., physiology) of the somatic and autonomic systems can most easily be demonstrated\\nthrough a simple reflex action. When you touch a hot stove, you pull your hand away. Sensory receptors in the skin\\nsense extreme temperature and the early signs of tissue damage. This triggers an action potential, which travels\\nalong the sensory fiber from the skin, through the dorsal spinal root to the spinal cord, and directly activates a\\nventral horn motor neuron. That neuron sends a signal along its axon to excite the biceps brachii, causing\\ncontraction of the muscle and flexion of the forearm at the elbow to withdraw the hand from the hot stove. The\\nwithdrawal reflex has more components, such as inhibiting the opposing muscle and balancing posture while the\\narm is forcefully withdrawn, which will be further explored at the end of this chapter.\\nThe basic withdrawal reflex explained above includes sensory input (the painful stimulus), central processing (the\\nsynapse in the spinal cord), and motor output (activation of a ventral motor neuron that causes contraction of the\\nbiceps brachii). Expanding the explanation of the withdrawal reflex can include inhibition of the opposing muscle, or\\ncross extension, either of which increase the complexity of the example by involving more central neurons. A\\nFigure 14.1 Too Hot to Touch When high temperature is sensed in the skin, a reflexive withdrawal is initiated by the muscles of the arm.\\nSensory neurons are activated by a stimulus, which is sent to the central nervous system, and a motor response is sent out to the skeletal\\nmuscles that control this movement.'),\n",

The cross extensor reflex provides a counterbalancing movement on\\nthe other side of the body, which requires another collateral of the sensory axon to activate contraction of the\\nextensor muscles in the contralateral limb.\\nA more complex example of somatic function is conscious muscle movement. For example, reading of this text\\nstarts with visual sensory input to the retina, which then projects to the thalamus, and on to the cerebral cortex. A\\nsequence of regions of the cerebral cortex process the visual information, starting in the primary visual cortex of the\\noccipital lobe, and resulting in the conscious perception of these letters. Subsequent cognitive processing results in\\nunderstanding of the content. As you continue reading, regions of the cerebral cortex in the frontal lobe plan how to\\nmove the eyes to follow the lines of text. The output from the cortex causes activity in motor neurons in the brain\\nstem that cause movement of the extraocular muscles through the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. This\\nexample also includes sensory input (the retinal projection to the thalamus), central processing (the thalamus and\\nsubsequent cortical activity), and motor output (activation of neurons in the brain stem that lead to coordinated\\ncontraction of extraocular muscles).\\n14.1 Sensory Perception\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe different types of sensory receptors\\n• Describe the structures responsible for the special senses of taste, smell, hearing, balance, and vision\\n• Distinguish how different tastes are transduced\\n• Describe the means of mechanoreception for hearing and balance\\n• List the supporting structures around the eye and describe the structure of the eyeball\\n• Describe the processes of phototransduction\\nA major role of sensory receptors is to help us learn about the environment around us, or about the state of our\\ninternal environment. Stimuli from varying sources, and of different types, are received and changed into the\\nelectrochemical signals of the nervous system. This occurs when a stimulus changes the cell membrane potential of\\na sensory neuron. The stimulus causes the sensory cell to produce an action potential that is relayed into the central\\nnervous system (CNS), where it is integrated with other sensory information—or sometimes higher cognitive\\nfunctions—to become a conscious perception of that stimulus. The central integration may then lead to a motor\\nresponse.\\nDescribing sensory function with the term sensation or perception is a deliberate distinction. Sensation is the\\nactivation of sensory receptor cells at the level of the stimulus. Perception is the central processing of sensory\\nstimuli into a meaningful pattern. Perception is dependent on sensation, but not all sensations are perceived.\\nReceptors are the cells or structures that detect sensations. A receptor cell is changed directly by a stimulus. A\\ntransmembrane protein receptor is a protein in the cell membrane that mediates a physiological change in a neuron,\\nmost often through the opening of ion channels or changes in the cell signaling processes. Transmembrane\\nreceptors are activated by chemicals called ligands. For example, a molecule in food can serve as a ligand for taste\\nreceptors. Other transmembrane proteins, which are not accurately called receptors, are sensitive to mechanical or\\nthermal changes. Physical changes in these proteins increase ion flow across the membrane, and can generate an\\naction potential or a graded potential in the sensory neurons.\\nSensory Receptors\\nStimuli in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the peripheral nervous system. Different types of\\nstimuli are sensed by different types of receptor cells. Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of\\nthree different criteria: cell type, position, and function. Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell\\ntype and their position in relation to stimuli they sense. They can also be classified functionally on the basis of the\\ntransduction of stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell membrane potential.\\nStructural Receptor Types\\nThe cells that interpret information about the environment can be either (1) a neuron that has a free nerve ending,\\n540 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The pain and temperature receptors in the dermis of the skin are examples of neurons that have free nerve\\nendings. Also located in the dermis of the skin are lamellated corpuscles, neurons with encapsulated nerve endings\\nthat respond to pressure and touch. The cells in the retina that respond to light stimuli are an example of a\\nspecialized receptor, a photoreceptor.\\nFIGURE 14.2 Receptor Classification by Cell Type Receptor cell types can be classified on the basis of their structure. Sensory\\nneurons can have either (a) free nerve endings or (b) encapsulated endings. Photoreceptors in the eyes, such as rod cells, are examples of\\n(c) specialized receptor cells. These cells release neurotransmitters onto a bipolar cell, which then synapses with the optic nerve neurons.\\nAnother way that receptors can be classified is based on their location relative to the stimuli. An exteroceptor is a\\nreceptor that is located near a stimulus in the external environment, such as the somatosensory receptors that are\\nlocated in the skin. An interoceptor is one that interprets stimuli from internal organs and tissues, such as the\\nreceptors that sense the increase in blood pressure in the aorta or carotid sinus. Finally, a proprioceptor is a\\nreceptor located near a moving part of the body, such as a muscle, that interprets the positions of the tissues as\\nthey move.\\nFunctional Receptor Types\\nA third classification of receptors is by how the receptor transduces stimuli into membrane potential changes.\\nStimuli are of three general types. Some stimuli are ions and macromolecules that affect transmembrane receptor\\nproteins when these chemicals diffuse across the cell membrane. Some stimuli are physical variations in the\\nenvironment that affect receptor cell membrane potentials. Other stimuli include the electromagnetic radiation from\\nvisible light. For humans, the only electromagnetic energy that is perceived by our eyes is visible light. Some other\\norganisms have receptors that humans lack, such as the heat sensors of snakes, the ultraviolet light sensors of\\nbees, or magnetic receptors in migratory birds.\\nReceptor cells can be further categorized on the basis of the type of stimuli they transduce. Chemical stimuli can be\\ninterpreted by a chemoreceptor that interprets chemical stimuli, such as an object’s taste or smell. Osmoreceptors\\nrespond to solute concentrations of body fluids. Additionally, pain is primarily a chemical sense that interprets the\\npresence of chemicals from tissue damage, or similar intense stimuli, through a nociceptor. Physical stimuli, such\\nas pressure and vibration, as well as the sensation of sound and body position (balance), are interpreted through a\\nmechanoreceptor. Another physical stimulus that has its own type of receptor is temperature, which is sensed\\nthrough a thermoreceptor that is either sensitive to temperatures above (heat) or below (cold) normal body\\ntemperature.\\nSensory Modalities\\nAsk anyone what the senses are, and they are likely to list the five major senses—taste, smell, touch, hearing, and\\nsight. However, these are not all of the senses. The most obvious omission from this list is balance. Also, what is\\nreferred to simply as touch can be further subdivided into pressure, vibration, stretch, and hair-follicle position, on\\n14.1 • Sensory Perception 541'),\n",

Other overlooked senses include\\ntemperature perception by thermoreceptors and pain perception by nociceptors.\\nWithin the realm of physiology, senses can be classified as either general or specific. A general sense is one that is\\ndistributed throughout the body and has receptor cells within the structures of other organs. Mechanoreceptors in\\nthe skin, muscles, or the walls of blood vessels are examples of this type. General senses often contribute to the\\nsense of touch, as described above, or to proprioception (body movement) and kinesthesia (body movement), or to\\na visceral sense, which is most important to autonomic functions. A special sense is one that has a specific organ\\ndevoted to it, namely the eye, inner ear, tongue, or nose.\\nEach of the senses is referred to as a sensory modality. Modality refers to the way that information is encoded,\\nwhich is similar to the idea of transduction. The main sensory modalities can be described on the basis of how each\\nis transduced. The chemical senses are taste and smell. The general sense that is usually referred to as touch\\nincludes chemical sensation in the form of nociception, or pain. Pressure, vibration, muscle stretch, and the\\nmovement of hair by an external stimulus, are all sensed by mechanoreceptors. Hearing and balance are also\\nsensed by mechanoreceptors. Finally, vision involves the activation of photoreceptors.\\nListing all the different sensory modalities, which can number as many as 17, involves separating the five major\\nsenses into more specific categories, or submodalities, of the larger sense. An individual sensory modality\\nrepresents the sensation of a specific type of stimulus. For example, the general sense of touch, which is known as\\nsomatosensation, can be separated into light pressure, deep pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or hair\\nmovement.\\nGustation (Taste)\\nOnly a few recognized submodalities exist within the sense of taste, or gustation. Until recently, only four tastes\\nwere recognized: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Research at the turn of the 20th century led to recognition of the fifth\\ntaste, umami, during the mid-1980s. Umami is a Japanese word that means “delicious taste,” and is often\\ntranslated to mean savory. Very recent research has suggested that there may also be a sixth taste for fats, or lipids.\\nGustation is the special sense associated with the tongue. The surface of the tongue, along with the rest of the oral\\ncavity, is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium. Raised bumps called papillae (singular = papilla) contain the\\nstructures for gustatory transduction. There are four types of papillae, based on their appearance (Figure 14.3):\\ncircumvallate, foliate, filiform, and fungiform. Within the structure of the papillae are taste buds that contain\\nspecialized gustatory receptor cells for the transduction of taste stimuli. These receptor cells are sensitive to the\\nchemicals contained within foods that are ingested, and they release neurotransmitters based on the amount of the\\nchemical in the food. Neurotransmitters from the gustatory cells can activate sensory neurons in the facial,\\nglossopharyngeal, and vagus cranial nerves.\\n542 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Different types of papillae are found in different regions of the tongue. The taste buds contain\\nspecialized gustatory receptor cells that respond to chemical stimuli dissolved in the saliva. These receptor cells activate sensory neurons\\nthat are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical\\nSchool © 2012)\\nSalty taste is simply the perception of sodium ions (Na+) in the saliva. When you eat something salty, the salt\\ncrystals dissociate into the component ions Na+ and Cl–, which dissolve into the saliva in your mouth. The Na+\\nconcentration becomes high outside the gustatory cells, creating a strong concentration gradient that drives the\\ndiffusion of the ion into the cells. The entry of Na+ into these cells results in the depolarization of the cell membrane\\nand the generation of a receptor potential.\\nSour taste is the perception of H+ concentration. Just as with sodium ions in salty flavors, these hydrogen ions enter\\nthe cell and trigger depolarization. Sour flavors are, essentially, the perception of acids in our food. Increasing\\nhydrogen ion concentrations in the saliva (lowering saliva pH) triggers progressively stronger graded potentials in\\nthe gustatory cells. For example, orange juice—which contains citric acid—will taste sour because it has a pH value\\nof approximately 3. Of course, it is often sweetened so that the sour taste is masked.\\nThe first two tastes (salty and sour) are triggered by the cations Na+ and H+. The other tastes result from food\\nmolecules binding to a G protein–coupled receptor. A G protein signal transduction system ultimately leads to\\ndepolarization of the gustatory cell. The sweet taste is the sensitivity of gustatory cells to the presence of glucose\\ndissolved in the saliva. Other monosaccharides such as fructose, or artificial sweeteners such as aspartame\\n(NutraSweet™), saccharine, or sucralose (Splenda™) also activate the sweet receptors. The affinity for each of these\\nmolecules varies, and some will taste sweeter than glucose because they bind to the G protein–coupled receptor\\ndifferently.\\nBitter taste is similar to sweet in that food molecules bind to G protein–coupled receptors. However, there are a\\nnumber of different ways in which this can happen because there are a large diversity of bitter-tasting molecules.\\nSome bitter molecules depolarize gustatory cells, whereas others hyperpolarize gustatory cells. Likewise, some\\nbitter molecules increase G protein activation within the gustatory cells, whereas other bitter molecules decrease G\\n14.1 • Sensory Perception 543'),\n",

The specific response depends on which molecule is binding to the receptor.\\nOne major group of bitter-tasting molecules are alkaloids. Alkaloids are nitrogen containing molecules that are\\ncommonly found in bitter-tasting plant products, such as coffee, hops (in beer), tannins (in wine), tea, and aspirin.\\nBy containing toxic alkaloids, the plant is less susceptible to microbe infection and less attractive to herbivores.\\nTherefore, the function of bitter taste may primarily be related to stimulating the gag reflex to avoid ingesting\\npoisons. Because of this, many bitter foods that are normally ingested are often combined with a sweet component\\nto make them more palatable (cream and sugar in coffee, for example). The highest concentration of bitter receptors\\nappear to be in the posterior tongue, where a gag reflex could still spit out poisonous food.\\nThe taste known as umami is often referred to as the savory taste. Like sweet and bitter, it is based on the activation\\nof G protein–coupled receptors by a specific molecule. The molecule that activates this receptor is the amino acid L-\\nglutamate. Therefore, the umami flavor is often perceived while eating protein-rich foods. Not surprisingly, dishes\\nthat contain meat are often described as savory.\\nOnce the gustatory cells are activated by the taste molecules, they release neurotransmitters onto the dendrites of\\nsensory neurons. These neurons are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, as well as a component\\nwithin the vagus nerve dedicated to the gag reflex. The facial nerve connects to taste buds in the anterior third of the\\ntongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve connects to taste buds in the posterior two thirds of the tongue. The vagus\\nnerve connects to taste buds in the extreme posterior of the tongue, verging on the pharynx, which are more\\nsensitive to noxious stimuli such as bitterness.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/DanielleReed) to learn about Dr. Danielle Reed of the Monell Chemical\\nSenses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who became interested in science at an early age because of her\\nsensory experiences. She recognized that her sense of taste was unique compared with other people she knew.\\nNow, she studies the genetic differences between people and their sensitivities to taste stimuli. In the video, there is\\na brief image of a person sticking out their tongue, which has been covered with a colored dye. This is how Dr. Reed\\nis able to visualize and count papillae on the surface of the tongue. People fall into two groups known as “tasters”\\nand “non-tasters” based on the density of papillae on their tongue, which also indicates the number of taste buds.\\nNon-tasters can taste food, but they are not as sensitive to certain tastes, such as bitterness. Dr. Reed discovered\\nthat she is a non-taster, which explains why she perceived bitterness differently than other people she knew. Are\\nyou very sensitive to tastes? Can you see any similarities among the members of your family?\\nOlfaction (Smell)\\nLike taste, the sense of smell, or olfaction, is also responsive to chemical stimuli. The olfactory receptor neurons are\\nlocated in a small region within the superior nasal cavity (Figure 14.4). This region is referred to as the olfactory\\nepithelium and contains bipolar sensory neurons. Each olfactory sensory neuron has dendrites that extend from\\nthe apical surface of the epithelium into the mucus lining the cavity. As airborne molecules are inhaled through the\\nnose, they pass over the olfactory epithelial region and dissolve into the mucus. These odorant molecules bind to\\nproteins that keep them dissolved in the mucus and help transport them to the olfactory dendrites. The\\nodorant–protein complex binds to a receptor protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite. These\\nreceptors are G protein–coupled, and will produce a graded membrane potential in the olfactory neurons.\\nThe axon of an olfactory neuron extends from the basal surface of the epithelium, through an olfactory foramen in\\nthe cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and into the brain. The group of axons called the olfactory tract connect to\\nthe olfactory bulb on the ventral surface of the frontal lobe. From there, the axons split to travel to several brain\\nregions. Some travel to the cerebrum, specifically to the primary olfactory cortex that is located in the inferior and\\nmedial areas of the temporal lobe. Others project to structures within the limbic system and hypothalamus, where\\nsmells become associated with long-term memory and emotional responses. This is how certain smells trigger\\nemotional memories, such as the smell of food associated with one’s birthplace. Smell is the one sensory modality\\nthat does not synapse in the thalamus before connecting to the cerebral cortex. This intimate connection between\\nthe olfactory system and the cerebral cortex is one reason why smell can be a potent trigger of memories and\\nemotion.\\n544 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The large, fleshy structure on the lateral aspect of the head is known as the auricle. Some\\nsources will also refer to this structure as the pinna, though that term is more appropriate for a structure that can be\\nmoved, such as the external ear of a cat. The C-shaped curves of the auricle direct sound waves toward the auditory\\ncanal. The canal enters the skull through the external auditory meatus of the temporal bone. At the end of the\\nauditory canal is the tympanic membrane, or ear drum, which vibrates after it is struck by sound waves. The auricle,\\near canal, and tympanic membrane are often referred to as the external ear. The middle ear consists of a space\\nspanned by three small bones called the ossicles. The three ossicles are the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are\\nLatin names that roughly translate to hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane\\nand articulates with the incus. The incus, in turn, articulates with the stapes. The stapes is then attached to the\\ninner ear, where the sound waves will be transduced into a neural signal. The middle ear is connected to the\\npharynx through the Eustachian tube, which helps equilibrate air pressure across the tympanic membrane. The tube\\nis normally closed but will pop open when the muscles of the pharynx contract during swallowing or yawning.\\nFIGURE 14.5 Structures of the Ear The external ear contains the auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. The middle ear contains\\nthe ossicles and is connected to the pharynx by the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the cochlea and vestibule, which are\\nresponsible for audition and equilibrium, respectively.\\nThe inner ear is often described as a bony labyrinth, as it is composed of a series of canals embedded within the\\ntemporal bone. It has two separate regions, the cochlea and the vestibule, which are responsible for hearing and\\nbalance, respectively. The neural signals from these two regions are relayed to the brain stem through separate fiber\\nbundles. However, these two distinct bundles travel together from the inner ear to the brain stem as the\\nvestibulocochlear nerve. Sound is transduced into neural signals within the cochlear region of the inner ear, which\\ncontains the sensory neurons of the spiral ganglia. These ganglia are located within the spiral-shaped cochlea of\\nthe inner ear. The cochlea is attached to the stapes through the oval window.\\nThe oval window is located at the beginning of a fluid-filled tube within the cochlea called the scala vestibuli. The\\nscala vestibuli extends from the oval window, travelling above the cochlear duct, which is the central cavity of the\\ncochlea that contains the sound-transducing neurons. At the uppermost tip of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli curves\\nover the top of the cochlear duct. The fluid-filled tube, now called the scala tympani, returns to the base of the\\ncochlea, this time travelling under the cochlear duct.

Because the tectorial membrane only moves where the basilar membrane moves, the hair cells in this\\nregion will also only respond to sounds of this specific frequency. Therefore, as the frequency of a sound changes,\\ndifferent hair cells are activated all along the basilar membrane.

Head position is sensed by the\\nutricle and saccule, whereas head movement is sensed by the semicircular canals. The neural signals generated in\\nthe vestibular ganglion are transmitted through the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain stem and cerebellum.\\nThe utricle and saccule are both largely composed of macula tissue (plural = maculae). The macula is composed of\\nhair cells surrounded by support cells. The stereocilia of the hair cells extend into a viscous gel called the otolithic\\nmembrane (Figure 14.11). On top of the otolithic membrane is a layer of calcium carbonate crystals, called otoliths.\\nThe otoliths essentially make the otolithic membrane top-heavy. The otolithic membrane moves separately from the\\nmacula in response to head movements. Tilting the head causes the otolithic membrane to slide over the macula in\\nthe direction of gravity. The moving otolithic membrane, in turn, bends the sterocilia, causing some hair cells to\\ndepolarize as others hyperpolarize. The exact position of the head is interpreted by the brain based on the pattern of\\nhair-cell depolarization.\\nFIGURE 14.11 Linear Acceleration Coding by Maculae The maculae are specialized for sensing linear acceleration, such as when\\ngravity acts on the tilting head, or if the head starts moving in a straight line. The difference in inertia between the hair cell stereocilia and\\nthe otolithic membrane in which they are embedded leads to a shearing force that causes the stereocilia to bend in the direction of that\\nlinear acceleration.\\nThe semicircular canals are three ring-like extensions of the vestibule. One is oriented in the horizontal plane,\\nwhereas the other two are oriented in the vertical plane. The anterior and posterior vertical canals are oriented at\\napproximately 45 degrees relative to the sagittal plane (Figure 14.12).

The movement of two canals within a plane results in information about the direction in which the head is\\nmoving, and activation of all six canals can give a very precise indication of head movement in three dimensions.\\nSomatosensation (Touch)\\nSomatosensation is considered a general sense, as opposed to the special senses discussed in this section.\\nSomatosensation is the group of sensory modalities that are associated with touch, proprioception, and\\ninteroception. These modalities include pressure, vibration, light touch, tickle, itch, temperature, pain,\\nproprioception, and kinesthesia. This means that its receptors are not associated with a specialized organ, but are\\ninstead spread throughout the body in a variety of organs. Many of the somatosensory receptors are located in the\\nskin, but receptors are also found in muscles, tendons, joint capsules, ligaments, and in the walls of visceral organs.\\nTwo types of somatosensory signals that are transduced by free nerve endings are pain and temperature. These two\\nmodalities use thermoreceptors and nociceptors to transduce temperature and pain stimuli, respectively.\\nTemperature receptors are stimulated when local temperatures differ from body temperature. Some\\nthermoreceptors are sensitive to just cold and others to just heat. Nociception is the sensation of potentially\\ndamaging stimuli. Mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli beyond a set threshold will elicit painful sensations.\\nStressed or damaged tissues release chemicals that activate receptor proteins in the nociceptors. For example, the\\nsensation of heat associated with spicy foods involves capsaicin, the active molecule in hot peppers. Capsaicin\\nmolecules bind to a transmembrane ion channel in nociceptors that is sensitive to temperatures above 37°C. The\\ndynamics of capsaicin binding with this transmembrane ion channel is unusual in that the molecule remains bound\\nfor a long time. Because of this, it will decrease the ability of other stimuli to elicit pain sensations through the\\nactivated nociceptor. For this reason, capsaicin can be used as a topical analgesic, such as in products such as Icy\\nHot™.\\nIf you drag your finger across a textured surface, the skin of your finger will vibrate. Such low frequency vibrations\\nare sensed by mechanoreceptors called Merkel cells, also known as type I cutaneous mechanoreceptors. Merkel\\ncells are located in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Deep pressure and vibration is transduced by lamellated\\n(Pacinian) corpuscles, which are receptors with encapsulated endings found deep in the dermis, or subcutaneous\\ntissue. Light touch is transduced by the encapsulated endings known as tactile (Meissner) corpuscles. Follicles are\\nalso wrapped in a plexus of nerve endings known as the hair follicle plexus. These nerve endings detect the\\nmovement of hair at the surface of the skin, such as when an insect may be walking along the skin. Stretching of the\\nskin is transduced by stretch receptors known as bulbous corpuscles. Bulbous corpuscles are also known as Ruffini\\ncorpuscles, or type II cutaneous mechanoreceptors.\\nOther somatosensory receptors are found in the joints and muscles. Stretch receptors monitor the stretching of\\ntendons, muscles, and the components of joints. For example, have you ever stretched your muscles before or after\\nexercise and noticed that you can only stretch so far before your muscles spasm back to a less stretched state? This\\nspasm is a reflex that is initiated by stretch receptors to avoid muscle tearing. Such stretch receptors can also\\nprevent over-contraction of a muscle. In skeletal muscle tissue, these stretch receptors are called muscle spindles.\\n14.1 • Sensory Perception 551'),\n",

The\\neyes are located within either orbit in the skull. The bony orbits surround the eyeballs, protecting them and\\nanchoring the soft tissues of the eye (Figure 14.13). The eyelids, with lashes at their leading edges, help to protect\\nthe eye from abrasions by blocking particles that may land on the surface of the eye. The inner surface of each lid is\\na thin membrane known as the palpebral conjunctiva. The conjunctiva extends over the white areas of the eye (the\\nsclera), connecting the eyelids to the eyeball. Tears are produced by the lacrimal gland, located just inside the\\norbit, superior and lateral to the eyeball. Tears produced by this gland flow through the lacrimal duct to the medial\\ncorner of the eye, where the tears flow over the conjunctiva, washing away foreign particles.\\n552 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The orbit is surrounded by cranial bones of the skull.\\nMovement of the eye within the orbit is accomplished by the contraction of six extraocular muscles that originate\\nfrom the bones of the orbit and insert into the surface of the eyeball (Figure 14.14). Four of the muscles are\\narranged at the cardinal points around the eye and are named for those locations. They are the superior rectus,\\nmedial rectus, inferior rectus, and lateral rectus. When each of these muscles contract, the eye moves toward the\\ncontracting muscle. For example, when the superior rectus contracts, the eye rotates to look up. The superior\\noblique originates at the posterior orbit, near the origin of the four rectus muscles. However, the tendon of the\\noblique muscles threads through a pulley-like piece of cartilage known as the trochlea. The tendon inserts obliquely\\ninto the superior surface of the eye. The angle of the tendon through the trochlea means that contraction of the\\nsuperior oblique rotates the eye laterally. The inferior oblique muscle originates from the floor of the orbit and\\ninserts into the inferolateral surface of the eye. When it contracts, it laterally rotates the eye, in opposition to the\\nsuperior oblique. Rotation of the eye by the two oblique muscles is necessary because the eye is not perfectly\\naligned on the sagittal plane. When the eye looks up or down, the eye must also rotate slightly to compensate for the\\nsuperior rectus pulling at approximately a 20-degree angle, rather than straight up. The same is true for the inferior\\nrectus, which is compensated by contraction of the inferior oblique. A seventh muscle in the orbit is the levator\\npalpebrae superioris, which is responsible for elevating and retracting the upper eyelid, a movement that usually\\noccurs in concert with elevation of the eye by the superior rectus (see Figure 14.13).\\nThe extraocular muscles are innervated by three cranial nerves. The lateral rectus, which causes abduction of the\\neye, is innervated by the abducens nerve. The superior oblique is innervated by the trochlear nerve. All of the other\\nmuscles are innervated by the oculomotor nerve, as is the levator palpebrae superioris. The motor nuclei of these\\ncranial nerves connect to the brain stem, which coordinates eye movements.\\nFIGURE 14.14 Extraocular Muscles The extraocular muscles move the eye within the orbit.\\n14.1 • Sensory Perception 553'),\n",

The outermost layer is the fibrous tunic, which\\nincludes the white sclera and clear cornea. The sclera accounts for five sixths of the surface of the eye, most of\\nwhich is not visible, though humans are unique compared with many other species in having so much of the “white\\nof the eye” visible (Figure 14.15). The transparent cornea covers the anterior tip of the eye and allows light to enter\\nthe eye. The middle layer of the eye is the vascular tunic, which is mostly composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and\\niris. The choroid is a layer of highly vascularized connective tissue that provides a blood supply to the eyeball. The\\nchoroid is posterior to the ciliary body, a muscular structure that is attached to the lens by suspensory ligaments,\\nor zonule fibers. These two structures bend the lens, allowing it to focus light on the back of the eye. Overlaying the\\nciliary body, and visible in the anterior eye, is the iris—the colored part of the eye. The iris is a smooth muscle that\\nopens or closes the pupil, which is the hole at the center of the eye that allows light to enter. The iris constricts the\\npupil in response to bright light and dilates the pupil in response to dim light. The innermost layer of the eye is the\\nneural tunic, or retina, which contains the nervous tissue responsible for photoreception.\\nThe eye is also divided into two cavities: the anterior cavity and the posterior cavity. The anterior cavity is the space\\nbetween the cornea and lens, including the iris and ciliary body. It is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous\\nhumor. The posterior cavity is the space behind the lens that extends to the posterior side of the interior eyeball,\\nwhere the retina is located. The posterior cavity is filled with a more viscous fluid called the vitreous humor.\\nThe retina is composed of several layers and contains specialized cells for the initial processing of visual stimuli. The\\nphotoreceptors (rods and cones) change their membrane potential when stimulated by light energy. The change in\\nmembrane potential alters the amount of neurotransmitter that the photoreceptor cells release onto bipolar cells in\\nthe outer synaptic layer. It is the bipolar cell in the retina that connects a photoreceptor to a retinal ganglion cell\\n(RGC) in the inner synaptic layer. There, amacrine cells additionally contribute to retinal processing before an\\naction potential is produced by the RGC. The axons of RGCs, which lie at the innermost layer of the retina, collect at\\nthe optic disc and leave the eye as the optic nerve (see Figure 14.15). Because these axons pass through the\\nretina, there are no photoreceptors at the very back of the eye, where the optic nerve begins. This creates a “blind\\nspot” in the retina, and a corresponding blind spot in our visual field.\\nFIGURE 14.15 Structure of the Eye The sphere of the eye can be divided into anterior and posterior chambers. The wall of the eye is\\ncomposed of three layers: the fibrous tunic, vascular tunic, and neural tunic. Within the neural tunic is the retina, with three layers of cells\\nand two synaptic layers in between. The center of the retina has a small indentation known as the fovea.\\nNote that the photoreceptors in the retina (rods and cones) are located behind the axons, RGCs, bipolar cells, and\\nretinal blood vessels. A significant amount of light is absorbed by these structures before the light reaches the\\nphotoreceptor cells. However, at the exact center of the retina is a small area known as the fovea. At the fovea, the\\nretina lacks the supporting cells and blood vessels, and only contains photoreceptors. Therefore, visual acuity, or\\nthe sharpness of vision, is greatest at the fovea. This is because the fovea is where the least amount of incoming\\nlight is absorbed by other retinal structures (see Figure 14.15).

In addition, each photoreceptor cell of the fovea is connected to\\na single RGC. Therefore, this RGC does not have to integrate inputs from multiple photoreceptors, which reduces the\\naccuracy of visual transduction. Toward the edges of the retina, several photoreceptors converge on RGCs (through\\nthe bipolar cells) up to a ratio of 50 to 1. The difference in visual acuity between the fovea and peripheral retina is\\neasily evidenced by looking directly at a word in the middle of this paragraph. The visual stimulus in the middle of\\nthe field of view falls on the fovea and is in the sharpest focus. Without moving your eyes off that word, notice that\\nwords at the beginning or end of the paragraph are not in focus. The images in your peripheral vision are focused by\\nthe peripheral retina, and have vague, blurry edges and words that are not as clearly identified. As a result, a large\\npart of the neural function of the eyes is concerned with moving the eyes and head so that important visual stimuli\\nare centered on the fovea.\\nLight falling on the retina causes chemical changes to pigment molecules in the photoreceptors, ultimately leading\\nto a change in the activity of the RGCs. Photoreceptor cells have two parts, the inner segment and the outer\\nsegment (Figure 14.16). The inner segment contains the nucleus and other common organelles of a cell, whereas\\nthe outer segment is a specialized region in which photoreception takes place. There are two types of\\nphotoreceptors—rods and cones—which differ in the shape of their outer segment. The rod-shaped outer segments\\nof the rod photoreceptor contain a stack of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment\\nrhodopsin. The cone-shaped outer segments of the cone photoreceptor contain their photosensitive pigments in\\ninfoldings of the cell membrane. There are three cone photopigments, called opsins, which are each sensitive to a\\nparticular wavelength of light. The wavelength of visible light determines its color. The pigments in human eyes are\\nspecialized in perceiving three different primary colors: red, green, and blue.\\n14.1 • Sensory Perception 555'),\n",

When a photon hits retinal, the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule\\nis biochemically altered. Specifically, photons cause some of the double-bonded carbons within the chain to switch\\nfrom a cis to a trans conformation. This process is called photoisomerization. Before interacting with a photon,\\nretinal’s flexible double-bonded carbons are in the cis conformation. This molecule is referred to as 11-cis-retinal. A\\nphoton interacting with the molecule causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans-\\nconformation, forming all-trans-retinal, which has a straight hydrocarbon chain (Figure 14.17).\\nThe shape change of retinal in the photoreceptors initiates visual transduction in the retina. Activation of retinal and\\nthe opsin proteins result in activation of a G protein. The G protein changes the membrane potential of the\\nphotoreceptor cell, which then releases less neurotransmitter into the outer synaptic layer of the retina. Until the\\nretinal molecule is changed back to the 11-cis-retinal shape, the opsin cannot respond to light energy, which is\\ncalled bleaching. When a large group of photopigments is bleached, the retina will send information as if opposing\\nvisual information is being perceived. After a bright flash of light, afterimages are usually seen in negative. The\\nphotoisomerization is reversed by a series of enzymatic changes so that the retinal responds to more light energy.\\nFIGURE 14.17 Retinal Isomers The retinal molecule has two isomers, (a) one before a photon interacts with it and (b) one that is\\naltered through photoisomerization.\\nThe opsins are sensitive to limited wavelengths of light.

Explain your answer.\\nSensory Nerves\\nOnce any sensory cell transduces a stimulus into a nerve impulse, that impulse has to travel along axons to reach\\nthe CNS. In many of the special senses, the axons leaving the sensory receptors have a topographical arrangement,\\nmeaning that the location of the sensory receptor relates to the location of the axon in the nerve. For example, in the\\nretina, axons from RGCs in the fovea are located at the center of the optic nerve, where they are surrounded by\\naxons from the more peripheral RGCs.\\nSpinal Nerves\\nGenerally, spinal nerves contain afferent axons from sensory receptors in the periphery, such as from the skin,\\nmixed with efferent axons travelling to the muscles or other effector organs. As the spinal nerve nears the spinal\\ncord, it splits into dorsal and ventral roots. The dorsal root contains only the axons of sensory neurons, whereas the\\nventral roots contain only the axons of the motor neurons. Some of the branches will synapse with local neurons in\\nthe dorsal root ganglion, posterior (dorsal) horn, or even the anterior (ventral) horn, at the level of the spinal cord\\nwhere they enter.

A simple case is a reflex caused by a synapse between a dorsal sensory neuron axon and a motor\\nneuron in the ventral horn. More complex arrangements are possible to integrate peripheral sensory information\\nwith higher processes. The important regions of the CNS that play a role in somatic processes can be separated into\\nthe spinal cord brain stem, diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and subcortical structures.\\nSpinal Cord and Brain Stem\\nA sensory pathway that carries peripheral sensations to the brain is referred to as an ascending pathway, or\\nascending tract. The various sensory modalities each follow specific pathways through the CNS. Tactile and other\\nsomatosensory stimuli activate receptors in the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints throughout the entire body.\\nHowever, the somatosensory pathways are divided into two separate systems on the basis of the location of the\\nreceptor neurons. Somatosensory stimuli from below the neck pass along the sensory pathways of the spinal cord,\\nwhereas somatosensory stimuli from the head and neck travel through the cranial nerves—specifically, the\\ntrigeminal system.\\nThe dorsal column system (sometimes referred to as the dorsal column–medial lemniscus) and the spinothalamic\\ntract are two major pathways that bring sensory information to the brain (Figure 14.19). The sensory pathways in\\neach of these systems are composed of three successive neurons.\\nThe dorsal column system begins with the axon of a dorsal root ganglion neuron entering the dorsal root and joining\\nthe dorsal column white matter in the spinal cord. As axons of this pathway enter the dorsal column, they take on a\\npositional arrangement so that axons from lower levels of the body position themselves medially, whereas axons\\nfrom upper levels of the body position themselves laterally.

One target is the reticular formation,\\nwhich influences respiratory and cardiovascular functions in relation to body movements. A second target of the\\naxons of neurons in the vestibular nuclei is the spinal cord, which initiates the spinal reflexes involved with posture\\nand balance. To assist the visual system, fibers of the vestibular nuclei project to the oculomotor, trochlear, and\\nabducens nuclei to influence signals sent along the cranial nerves. These connections constitute the pathway of the\\nvestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which compensates for head and body movement by stabilizing images on the retina\\n(Figure 14.21).

This is different from “tunnel vision” because the superior and inferior peripheral\\nfields are not lost. Visual field deficits can be disturbing for a patient, but in this case, the cause is not within the\\nvisual system itself. A growth of the pituitary gland presses against the optic chiasm and interferes with signal\\ntransmission. However, the axons projecting to the same side of the brain are unaffected. Therefore, the patient\\nloses the outermost areas of their field of vision and cannot see objects to their right and left.\\nExtending from the optic chiasm, the axons of the visual system are referred to as the optic tract instead of the optic\\nnerve. The optic tract has three major targets, two in the diencephalon and one in the midbrain. The connection\\nbetween the eyes and diencephalon is demonstrated during development, in which the neural tissue of the retina\\ndifferentiates from that of the diencephalon by the growth of the secondary vesicles. The connections of the retina\\ninto the CNS are a holdover from this developmental association. The majority of the connections of the optic tract\\nare to the thalamus—specifically, the lateral geniculate nucleus. Axons from this nucleus then project to the visual\\ncortex of the cerebrum, located in the occipital lobe. Another target of the optic tract is the superior colliculus.\\nIn addition, a very small number of RGC axons project from the optic chiasm to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the\\nhypothalamus. These RGCs are photosensitive, in that they respond to the presence or absence of light. Unlike the\\nphotoreceptors, however, these photosensitive RGCs cannot be used to perceive images. By simply responding to\\nthe absence or presence of light, these RGCs can send information about day length. The perceived proportion of\\nsunlight to darkness establishes the circadian rhythm of our bodies, allowing certain physiological events to occur\\nat approximately the same time every day.\\nDiencephalon\\nThe diencephalon is beneath the cerebrum and includes the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the somatic nervous\\nsystem, the thalamus is an important relay for communication between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous\\nsystem. The hypothalamus has both somatic and autonomic functions.

Each\\nsensory system is relayed through a particular nucleus in the thalamus. The thalamus is a required transfer point for\\nmost sensory tracts that reach the cerebral cortex, where conscious sensory perception begins. The one exception\\nto this rule is the olfactory system. The olfactory tract axons from the olfactory bulb project directly to the cerebral\\ncortex, along with the limbic system and hypothalamus.\\nThe thalamus is a collection of several nuclei that can be categorized into three anatomical groups. White matter\\nrunning through the thalamus defines the three major regions of the thalamus, which are an anterior nucleus, a\\nmedial nucleus, and a lateral group of nuclei. The anterior nucleus serves as a relay between the hypothalamus and\\nthe emotion and memory-producing limbic system. The medial nuclei serve as a relay for information from the\\nlimbic system and basal ganglia to the cerebral cortex. This allows memory creation during learning, but also\\ndetermines alertness. The special and somatic senses connect to the lateral nuclei, where their information is\\nrelayed to the appropriate sensory cortex of the cerebrum.\\nCortical Processing\\nAs described earlier, many of the sensory axons are positioned in the same way as their corresponding receptor\\ncells in the body. This allows identification of the position of a stimulus on the basis of which receptor cells are\\nsending information. The cerebral cortex also maintains this sensory topography in the particular areas of the cortex\\nthat correspond to the position of the receptor cells. The somatosensory cortex provides an example in which, in\\nessence, the locations of the somatosensory receptors in the body are mapped onto the somatosensory cortex. This\\nmapping is often depicted using a sensory homunculus (Figure 14.23).\\nThe term homunculus comes from the Latin word for “little man” and refers to a map of the human body that is laid\\nacross a portion of the cerebral cortex. In the somatosensory cortex, the external genitals, feet, and lower legs are\\nrepresented on the medial face of the gyrus within the longitudinal fissure. As the gyrus curves out of the fissure and\\nalong the surface of the parietal lobe, the body map continues through the thighs, hips, trunk, shoulders, arms, and\\nhands. The head and face are just lateral to the fingers as the gyrus approaches the lateral sulcus. The\\nrepresentation of the body in this topographical map is medial to lateral from the lower to upper body. It is a\\ncontinuation of the topographical arrangement seen in the dorsal column system, where axons from the lower body\\nare carried in the fasciculus gracilis, whereas axons from the upper body are carried in the fasciculus cuneatus. As\\nthe dorsal column system continues into the medial lemniscus, these relationships are maintained. Also, the head\\nand neck axons running from the trigeminal nuclei to the thalamus run adjacent to the upper body fibers. The\\nconnections through the thalamus maintain topography such that the anatomic information is preserved. Note that\\nthis correspondence does not result in a perfectly miniature scale version of the body, but rather exaggerates the\\nmore sensitive areas of the body, such as the fingers and lower face. Less sensitive areas of the body, such as the\\nshoulders and back, are mapped to smaller areas on the cortex.\\n14.2 • Central Processing 565'),\n",

The visual field is projected onto the two retinae, as described above, with sorting at the optic chiasm. The\\nright peripheral visual field falls on the medial portion of the right retina and the lateral portion of the left retina. The\\nright medial retina then projects across the midline through the optic chiasm. This results in the right visual field\\nbeing processed in the left visual cortex. Likewise, the left visual field is processed in the right visual cortex (see\\nFigure 14.22). Though the chiasm is helping to sort right and left visual information, superior and inferior visual\\ninformation is maintained topographically in the visual pathway. Light from the superior visual field falls on the\\ninferior retina, and light from the inferior visual field falls on the superior retina. This topography is maintained such\\nthat the superior region of the visual cortex processes the inferior visual field and vice versa. Therefore, the visual\\nfield information is inverted and reversed as it enters the visual cortex—up is down, and left is right. However, the\\ncortex processes the visual information such that the final conscious perception of the visual field is correct. The\\ntopographic relationship is evident in that information from the foveal region of the retina is processed in the center\\nof the primary visual cortex. Information from the peripheral regions of the retina are correspondingly processed\\ntoward the edges of the visual cortex. Similar to the exaggerations in the sensory homunculus of the somatosensory\\ncortex, the foveal-processing area of the visual cortex is disproportionately larger than the areas processing\\nperipheral vision.\\nIn an experiment performed in the 1960s, subjects wore prism glasses so that the visual field was inverted before\\nreaching the eye. On the first day of the experiment, subjects would duck when walking up to a table, thinking it was\\nsuspended from the ceiling. However, after a few days of acclimation, the subjects behaved as if everything were\\nrepresented correctly.

If movement of a visual stimulus is leftward in one eye and rightward in the opposite eye, the brain\\ninterprets this as movement toward (or away) from the face along the midline. If both eyes see an object moving in\\nthe same direction, but at different rates, what would that mean for spatial movement?\\nEveryday Connection\\nDepth Perception, 3-D Movies, and Optical Illusions\\nThe visual field is projected onto the retinal surface, where photoreceptors transduce light energy into neural\\nsignals for the brain to interpret. The retina is a two-dimensional surface, so it does not encode three-\\ndimensional information. However, we can perceive depth. How is that accomplished?\\nTwo ways in which we can extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal signal are based on\\nmonocular cues and binocular cues, respectively. Monocular depth cues are those that are the result of\\ninformation within the two-dimensional visual field. One object that overlaps another object has to be in front.\\nRelative size differences are also a cue. For example, if a basketball appears larger than the basket, then the\\nbasket must be further away. On the basis of experience, we can estimate how far away the basket is. Binocular\\ndepth cues compare information represented in the two retinae because they do not see the visual field exactly\\nthe same.\\nThe centers of the two eyes are separated by a small distance, which is approximately 6 to 6.5 cm in most\\npeople. Because of this offset, visual stimuli do not fall on exactly the same spot on both retinae unless we are\\nfixated directly on them and they fall on the fovea of each retina. All other objects in the visual field, either closer\\nor farther away than the fixated object, will fall on different spots on the retina. When vision is fixed on an object\\nin space, closer objects will fall on the lateral retina of each eye, and more distant objects will fall on the medial\\nretina of either eye (Figure 14.25). This is easily observed by holding a finger up in front of your face as you look\\nat a more distant object. You will see two images of your finger that represent the two disparate images that are\\nfalling on either retina.\\nThese depth cues, both monocular and binocular, can be exploited to make the brain think there are three\\ndimensions in two-dimensional information. This is the basis of 3-D movies. The projected image on the screen\\nis two dimensional, but it has disparate information embedded in it. The 3-D glasses that are available at the\\ntheater filter the information so that only one eye sees one version of what is on the screen, and the other eye\\nsees the other version. If you take the glasses off, the image on the screen will have varying amounts of blur\\nbecause both eyes are seeing both layers of information, and the third dimension will not be evident. Some\\noptical illusions can take advantage of depth cues as well, though those are more often using monocular cues to\\nfool the brain into seeing different parts of the scene as being at different depths.\\n568 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A particular sensory deficit that inhibits an\\nimportant social function of humans is prosopagnosia, or face blindness. The word comes from the Greek words\\nprosopa, that means “faces,” and agnosia, that means “not knowing.” Some people may feel that they cannot\\nrecognize people easily by their faces. However, a person with prosopagnosia cannot recognize the most\\nrecognizable people in their respective cultures. They would not recognize the face of a celebrity, an important\\nhistorical figure, or even a family member like their mother. They may not even recognize their own face.\\nProsopagnosia can be caused by trauma to the brain, or it can be present from birth. The exact cause of\\nproposagnosia and the reason that it happens to some people is unclear. A study of the brains of people born\\nwith the deficit found that a specific region of the brain, the anterior fusiform gyrus of the temporal lobe, is often\\nunderdeveloped. This region of the brain is concerned with the recognition of visual stimuli and its possible\\nassociation with memories. Though the evidence is not yet definitive, this region is likely to be where facial\\nrecognition occurs.\\nThough this can be a devastating condition, people who suffer from it can get by—often by using other cues to\\nrecognize the people they see. Often, the sound of a person’s voice, or the presence of unique cues such as\\ndistinct facial features (a mole, for example) or hair color can help the sufferer recognize a familiar person.

Somatic senses inform\\nthe nervous system about the external environment, but the response to that is through voluntary muscle\\nmovement. The term “voluntary” suggests that there is a conscious decision to make a movement. However, some\\naspects of the somatic system use voluntary muscles without conscious control. One example is the ability of our\\nbreathing to switch to unconscious control while we are focused on another task. However, the muscles that are\\nresponsible for the basic process of breathing are also utilized for speech, which is entirely voluntary.\\nCortical Responses\\nLet’s start with sensory stimuli that have been registered through receptor cells and the information relayed to the\\nCNS along ascending pathways. In the cerebral cortex, the initial processing of sensory perception progresses to\\nassociative processing and then integration in multimodal areas of cortex. These levels of processing can lead to the\\nincorporation of sensory perceptions into memory, but more importantly, they lead to a response. The completion of\\ncortical processing through the primary, associative, and integrative sensory areas initiates a similar progression of\\nmotor processing, usually in different cortical areas.\\nWhereas the sensory cortical areas are located in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes, motor functions are\\nlargely controlled by the frontal lobe (See Figure 13.7). The most anterior regions of the frontal lobe—the prefrontal\\nareas—are important for executive functions, which are those cognitive functions that lead to goal-directed\\nbehaviors. These higher cognitive processes include working memory, which has been called a “mental scratch\\npad,” that can help organize and represent information that is not in the immediate environment. The prefrontal lobe\\nis responsible for aspects of attention, such as inhibiting distracting thoughts and actions so that a person can focus\\non a goal and direct behavior toward achieving that goal.\\nThe functions of the prefrontal cortex are integral to the personality of an individual, because it is largely responsible\\nfor what a person intends to do and how they accomplish those plans. A famous case of damage to the prefrontal\\ncortex is that of Phineas Gage, dating back to 1848. He was a railroad worker who had a metal spike impale his\\nprefrontal cortex (Figure 14.27). He survived the accident, but according to second-hand accounts, his personality\\nchanged drastically. Friends described him as no longer acting like himself. Whereas he was a hardworking, amiable\\nman before the accident, he turned into an irritable, temperamental, and lazy man after the accident. Many of the\\naccounts of his change may have been inflated in the retelling, and some behavior was likely attributable to alcohol\\nused as a pain medication. However, the accounts suggest that some aspects of his personality did change. Also,\\nthere is new evidence that though his life changed dramatically, he was able to become a functioning stagecoach\\ndriver, suggesting that the brain has the ability to recover even from major trauma such as this.\\n14.3 • Motor Responses 571'),\n",

Harlow, MD)\\nSecondary Motor Cortices\\nIn generating motor responses, the executive functions of the prefrontal cortex will need to initiate actual\\nmovements. One way to define the prefrontal area is any region of the frontal lobe that does not elicit movement\\nwhen electrically stimulated. These are primarily in the anterior part of the frontal lobe. The regions of the frontal\\nlobe that remain are the regions of the cortex that produce movement. The prefrontal areas project into the\\nsecondary motor cortices, which include the premotor cortex and the supplemental motor area.\\nTwo important regions that assist in planning and coordinating movements are located adjacent to the primary\\nmotor cortex. The premotor cortex is more lateral, whereas the supplemental motor area is more medial and\\nsuperior. The premotor area aids in controlling movements of the core muscles to maintain posture during\\nmovement, whereas the supplemental motor area is hypothesized to be responsible for planning and coordinating\\nmovement. The supplemental motor area also manages sequential movements that are based on prior experience\\n(that is, learned movements). Neurons in these areas are most active leading up to the initiation of movement. For\\nexample, these areas might prepare the body for the movements necessary to drive a car in anticipation of a traffic\\nlight changing.\\nAdjacent to these two regions are two specialized motor planning centers. The frontal eye fields are responsible for\\nmoving the eyes in response to visual stimuli. There are direct connections between the frontal eye fields and the\\nsuperior colliculus. Also, anterior to the premotor cortex and primary motor cortex is Broca’s area. This area is\\nresponsible for controlling movements of the structures of speech production. The area is named after a French\\nsurgeon and anatomist who studied patients who could not produce speech. They did not have impairments to\\nunderstanding speech, only to producing speech sounds, suggesting a damaged or underdeveloped Broca’s area.\\nPrimary Motor Cortex\\nThe primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe.

Penfield would probe the surface of the cortex while the patient was only under local anesthesia so that\\nhe could observe responses to the stimulation. This led to the belief that the precentral gyrus directly stimulated\\nmuscle movement. We now know that the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas that aid in\\nplanning movement, and its principle output stimulates spinal cord neurons to stimulate skeletal muscle\\ncontraction.\\nThe primary motor cortex is arranged in a similar fashion to the primary somatosensory cortex, in that it has a\\ntopographical map of the body, creating a motor homunculus (see Figure 14.23). The neurons responsible for\\nmusculature in the feet and lower legs are in the medial wall of the precentral gyrus, with the thighs, trunk, and\\nshoulder at the crest of the longitudinal fissure. The hand and face are in the lateral face of the gyrus. Also, the\\nrelative space allotted for the different regions is exaggerated in muscles that have greater enervation. The greatest\\namount of cortical space is given to muscles that perform fine, agile movements, such as the muscles of the fingers\\nand the lower face. The “power muscles” that perform coarser movements, such as the buttock and back muscles,\\noccupy much less space on the motor cortex.\\nDescending Pathways\\nThe motor output from the cortex descends into the brain stem and to the spinal cord to control the musculature\\nthrough motor neurons. Neurons located in the primary motor cortex, named Betz cells, are large cortical neurons\\nthat synapse with lower motor neurons in the brain stem or in the spinal cord. The two descending pathways\\ntravelled by the axons of Betz cells are the corticobulbar tract and the corticospinal tract, respectively. Both tracts\\nare named for their origin in the cortex and their targets—either the brain stem (the term “bulbar” refers to the brain\\nstem as the bulb, or enlargement, at the top of the spinal cord) or the spinal cord.\\nThese two descending pathways are responsible for the conscious or voluntary movements of skeletal muscles. Any\\nmotor command from the primary motor cortex is sent down the axons of the Betz cells to activate lower motor\\nneurons in either the cranial motor nuclei or in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The axons of the corticobulbar\\ntract are ipsilateral, meaning they project from the cortex to the motor nucleus on the same side of the nervous\\nsystem. Conversely, the axons of the corticospinal tract are largely contralateral, meaning that they cross the\\nmidline of the brain stem or spinal cord and synapse on the opposite side of the body. Therefore, the right motor\\ncortex of the cerebrum controls muscles on the left side of the body, and vice versa.\\nThe corticospinal tract descends from the cortex through the deep white matter of the cerebrum. It then passes\\nbetween the caudate nucleus and putamen of the basal nuclei as a bundle called the internal capsule. The tract\\nthen passes through the midbrain as the cerebral peduncles, after which it burrows through the pons. Upon\\nentering the medulla, the tracts make up the large white matter tract referred to as the pyramids (Figure 14.28).\\nThe defining landmark of the medullary-spinal border is the pyramidal decussation, which is where most of the\\nfibers in the corticospinal tract cross over to the opposite side of the brain. At this point, the tract separates into two\\nparts, which have control over different domains of the musculature.\\n574 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The lower motor neurons are located in the medial regions of the ventral horn, because they\\ncontrol the axial muscles of the trunk.\\nBecause movements of the body trunk involve both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract is not entirely\\ncontralateral. Some collateral branches of the tract will project into the ipsilateral ventral horn to control synergistic\\nmuscles on that side of the body, or to inhibit antagonistic muscles through interneurons within the ventral horn.\\nThrough the influence of both sides of the body, the anterior corticospinal tract can coordinate postural muscles in\\nbroad movements of the body. These coordinating axons in the anterior corticospinal tract are often considered\\nbilateral, as they are both ipsilateral and contralateral.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/motorpathway) to learn more about the descending motor pathway for the\\nsomatic nervous system. The autonomic connections are mentioned, which are covered in another chapter. From\\nthis brief video, only some of the descending motor pathway of the somatic nervous system is described. Which\\ndivision of the pathway is described and which division is left out?\\nExtrapyramidal Controls\\nOther descending connections between the brain and the spinal cord are called the extrapyramidal system. The\\nname comes from the fact that this system is outside the corticospinal pathway, which includes the pyramids in the\\nmedulla. A few pathways originating from the brain stem contribute to this system.\\nThe tectospinal tract projects from the midbrain to the spinal cord and is important for postural movements that\\nare driven by the superior colliculus. The name of the tract comes from an alternate name for the superior colliculus,\\nwhich is the tectum. The reticulospinal tract connects the reticular system, a diffuse region of gray matter in the\\nbrain stem, with the spinal cord. This tract influences trunk and proximal limb muscles related to posture and\\nlocomotion. The reticulospinal tract also contributes to muscle tone and influences autonomic functions. The\\nvestibulospinal tract connects the brain stem nuclei of the vestibular system with the spinal cord. This allows\\nposture, movement, and balance to be modulated on the basis of equilibrium information provided by the vestibular\\nsystem.\\nThe pathways of the extrapyramidal system are influenced by subcortical structures. For example, connections\\nbetween the secondary motor cortices and the extrapyramidal system modulate spine and cranium movements.\\nThe basal nuclei, which are important for regulating movement initiated by the CNS, influence the extrapyramidal\\nsystem as well as its thalamic feedback to the motor cortex.\\nThe conscious movement of our muscles is more complicated than simply sending a single command from the\\nprecentral gyrus down to the proper motor neurons. During the movement of any body part, our muscles relay\\ninformation back to the brain, and the brain is constantly sending “revised” instructions back to the muscles. The\\ncerebellum is important in contributing to the motor system because it compares cerebral motor commands with\\nproprioceptive feedback. The corticospinal fibers that project to the ventral horn of the spinal cord have branches\\nthat also synapse in the pons, which project to the cerebellum. Also, the proprioceptive sensations of the dorsal\\ncolumn system have a collateral projection to the medulla that projects to the cerebellum. These two streams of\\ninformation are compared in the cerebellar cortex. Conflicts between the motor commands sent by the cerebrum\\nand body position information provided by the proprioceptors cause the cerebellum to stimulate the red nucleus of\\nthe midbrain. The red nucleus then sends corrective commands to the spinal cord along the rubrospinal tract. The\\n576 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 592}, page_content='name of this tract comes from the word for red that is seen in the English word “ruby.”\\nA good example of how the cerebellum corrects cerebral motor commands can be illustrated by walking in water. An\\noriginal motor command from the cerebrum to walk will result in a highly coordinated set of learned movements.\\nHowever, in water, the body cannot actually perform a typical walking movement as instructed. The cerebellum can\\nalter the motor command, stimulating the leg muscles to take larger steps to overcome the water resistance. The\\ncerebellum can make the necessary changes through the rubrospinal tract. Modulating the basic command to walk\\nalso relies on spinal reflexes, but the cerebellum is responsible for calculating the appropriate response. When the\\ncerebellum does not work properly, coordination and balance are severely affected. The most dramatic example of\\nthis is during the overconsumption of alcohol. Alcohol inhibits the ability of the cerebellum to interpret\\nproprioceptive feedback, making it more difficult to coordinate body movements, such as walking a straight line, or\\nguide the movement of the hand to touch the tip of the nose.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this site (http://openstax.org/l/NYTmotor) to read about an elderly woman who starts to lose the ability to\\ncontrol fine movements, such as speech and the movement of limbs. Many of the usual causes were ruled out. It\\nwas not a stroke, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, or thyroid dysfunction. The next most obvious cause was\\nmedication, so her pharmacist had to be consulted. The side effect of a drug meant to help her sleep had resulted in\\nchanges in motor control. What regions of the nervous system are likely to be the focus of haloperidol side effects?\\nVentral Horn Output\\nThe somatic nervous system provides output strictly to skeletal muscles. The lower motor neurons, which are\\nresponsible for the contraction of these muscles, are found in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These large,\\nmultipolar neurons have a corona of dendrites surrounding the cell body and an axon that extends out of the ventral\\nhorn. This axon travels through the ventral nerve root to join the emerging spinal nerve. The axon is relatively long\\nbecause it needs to reach muscles in the periphery of the body. The diameters of cell bodies may be on the order of\\nhundreds of micrometers to support the long axon; some axons are a meter in length, such as the lumbar motor\\nneurons that innervate muscles in the first digits of the feet.\\nThe axons will also branch to innervate multiple muscle fibers. Together, the motor neuron and all the muscle fibers\\nthat it controls make up a motor unit. Motor units vary in size. Some may contain up to 1000 muscle fibers, such as\\nin the quadriceps, or they may only have 10 fibers, such as in an extraocular muscle. The number of muscle fibers\\nthat are part of a motor unit corresponds to the precision of control of that muscle. Also, muscles that have finer\\nmotor control have more motor units connecting to them, and this requires a larger topographical field in the\\nprimary motor cortex.\\nMotor neuron axons connect to muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction. This is a specialized synaptic structure at\\nwhich multiple axon terminals synapse with the muscle fiber sarcolemma. The synaptic end bulbs of the motor\\nneurons secrete acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the sarcolemma. The binding of acetylcholine opens\\nligand-gated ion channels, increasing the movement of cations across the sarcolemma. This depolarizes the\\nsarcolemma, initiating muscle contraction. Whereas other synapses result in graded potentials that must reach a\\nthreshold in the postsynaptic target, activity at the neuromuscular junction reliably leads to muscle fiber contraction\\nwith every nerve impulse received from a motor neuron. However, the strength of contraction and the number of\\nfibers that contract can be affected by the frequency of the motor neuron impulses.\\nReflexes\\nThis chapter began by introducing reflexes as an example of the basic elements of the somatic nervous system.\\nSimple somatic reflexes do not include the higher centers discussed for conscious or voluntary aspects of\\nmovement. Reflexes can be spinal or cranial, depending on the nerves and central components that are involved.\\nThe example described at the beginning of the chapter involved heat and pain sensations from a hot stove causing\\nwithdrawal of the arm through a connection in the spinal cord that leads to contraction of the biceps brachii. The\\ndescription of this withdrawal reflex was simplified, for the sake of the introduction, to emphasize the parts of the\\nsomatic nervous system. But to consider reflexes fully, more attention needs to be given to this example.\\n14.3 • Motor Responses 577'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 593}, page_content='As you withdraw your hand from the stove, you do not want to slow that reflex down. As the biceps brachii contracts,\\nthe antagonistic triceps brachii needs to relax. Because the neuromuscular junction is strictly excitatory, the biceps\\nwill contract when the motor nerve is active. Skeletal muscles do not actively relax. Instead the motor neuron needs\\nto “quiet down,” or be inhibited. In the hot-stove withdrawal reflex, this occurs through an interneuron in the spinal\\ncord. The interneuron’s cell body is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The interneuron receives a synapse\\nfrom the axon of the sensory neuron that detects that the hand is being burned. In response to this stimulation from\\nthe sensory neuron, the interneuron then inhibits the motor neuron that controls the triceps brachii. This is done by\\nreleasing a neurotransmitter or other signal that hyperpolarizes the motor neuron connected to the triceps brachii,\\nmaking it less likely to initiate an action potential. With this motor neuron being inhibited, the triceps brachii relaxes.\\nWithout the antagonistic contraction, withdrawal from the hot stove is faster and keeps further tissue damage from\\noccurring.\\nAnother example of a withdrawal reflex occurs when you step on a painful stimulus, like a tack or a sharp rock. The\\nnociceptors that are activated by the painful stimulus activate the motor neurons responsible for contraction of the\\ntibialis anterior muscle. This causes dorsiflexion of the foot. An inhibitory interneuron, activated by a collateral\\nbranch of the nociceptor fiber, will inhibit the motor neurons of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to cancel\\nplantar flexion. An important difference in this reflex is that plantar flexion is most likely in progress as the foot is\\npressing down onto the tack. Contraction of the tibialis anterior is not the most important aspect of the reflex, as\\ncontinuation of plantar flexion will result in further damage from stepping onto the tack.\\nAnother type of reflex is a stretch reflex. In this reflex, when a skeletal muscle is stretched, a muscle spindle\\nreceptor is activated. The axon from this receptor structure will cause direct contraction of the muscle. A collateral\\nof the muscle spindle fiber will also inhibit the motor neuron of the antagonist muscles. The reflex helps to maintain\\nmuscles at a constant length. A common example of this reflex is the knee jerk that is elicited by a rubber hammer\\nstruck against the patellar ligament in a physical exam.\\nA specialized reflex to protect the surface of the eye is the corneal reflex, or the eye blink reflex. When the cornea is\\nstimulated by a tactile stimulus, or even by bright light in a related reflex, blinking is initiated. The sensory\\ncomponent travels through the trigeminal nerve, which carries somatosensory information from the face, or through\\nthe optic nerve, if the stimulus is bright light. The motor response travels through the facial nerve and innervates the\\norbicularis oculi on the same side. This reflex is commonly tested during a physical exam using an air puff or a gentle\\ntouch of a cotton-tipped applicator.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/reflexarc) to learn more about the reflex arc of the corneal reflex. When the\\nright cornea senses a tactile stimulus, what happens to the left eye? Explain your answer.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/newreflex) to learn more about newborn reflexes. Newborns have a set of\\nreflexes that are expected to have been crucial to survival before the modern age. These reflexes disappear as the\\nbaby grows, as some of them may be unnecessary as they age. The video demonstrates a reflex called the Babinski\\nreflex, in which the foot flexes dorsally and the toes splay out when the sole of the foot is lightly scratched. This is\\nnormal for newborns, but it is a sign of reduced myelination of the spinal tract in adults. Why would this reflex be a\\nproblem for an adult?\\n578 14 • The Somatic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

With the exception of somatosensation, this\\nlist represents the special senses, or those systems of\\nthe body that are associated with specific organs such\\nas the tongue or eye. Somatosensation belongs to the\\ngeneral senses, which are those sensory structures\\nthat are distributed throughout the body and in the\\nwalls of various organs. The special senses are all\\nprimarily part of the somatic nervous system in that\\nthey are consciously perceived through cerebral\\nprocesses, though some special senses contribute to\\nautonomic function. The general senses can be divided\\ninto somatosensation, which is commonly considered\\ntouch, but includes tactile, pressure, vibration,\\ntemperature, and pain perception. The general senses\\nalso include the visceral senses, which are separate\\nfrom the somatic nervous system function in that they\\ndo not normally rise to the level of conscious\\nperception.\\nThe cells that transduce sensory stimuli into the\\nelectrochemical signals of the nervous system are\\nclassified on the basis of structural or functional\\naspects of the cells. The structural classifications are\\neither based on the anatomy of the cell that is\\ninteracting with the stimulus (free nerve endings,\\nencapsulated endings, or specialized receptor cell), or\\nwhere the cell is located relative to the stimulus\\n(interoceptor, exteroceptor, proprioceptor).

Thermoreceptors are sensitive to\\ntemperature changes, and photoreceptors are\\nsensitive to light energy.\\nThe nerves that convey sensory information from the\\nperiphery to the CNS are either spinal nerves,\\nconnected to the spinal cord, or cranial nerves,\\nconnected to the brain. Spinal nerves have mixed\\npopulations of fibers; some are motor fibers and some\\nare sensory. The sensory fibers connect to the spinal\\ncord through the dorsal root, which is attached to the\\ndorsal root ganglion. Sensory information from the\\nbody that is conveyed through spinal nerves will\\nproject to the opposite side of the brain to be\\nprocessed by the cerebral cortex. The cranial nerves\\ncan be strictly sensory fibers, such as the olfactory,\\noptic, and vestibulocochlear nerves, or mixed sensory\\nand motor nerves, such as the trigeminal, facial,\\nglossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves. The cranial\\nnerves are connected to the same side of the brain\\nfrom which the sensory information originates.\\n14.2 Central Processing\\nSensory input to the brain enters through pathways\\nthat travel through either the spinal cord (for\\nsomatosensory input from the body) or the brain stem\\n(for everything else, except the visual and olfactory\\nsystems) to reach the diencephalon. In the\\ndiencephalon, sensory pathways reach the thalamus.\\nThis is necessary for all sensory systems to reach the\\ncerebral cortex, except for the olfactory system that is\\ndirectly connected to the frontal and temporal lobes.\\nThe two major tracts in the spinal cord, originating from\\nsensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, are the\\ndorsal column system and the spinothalamic tract. The\\nmajor differences between the two are in the type of\\ninformation that is relayed to the brain and where the\\ntracts decussate. The dorsal column system primarily\\ncarries information about touch and proprioception and\\ncrosses the midline in the medulla. The spinothalamic\\ntract is primarily responsible for pain and temperature\\nsensation and crosses the midline in the spinal cord at\\nthe level at which it enters. The trigeminal nerve adds\\nsimilar sensation information from the head to these\\npathways.\\nThe auditory pathway passes through multiple nuclei in\\nthe brain stem in which additional information is\\nextracted from the basic frequency stimuli processed\\nby the cochlea. Sound localization is made possible\\nthrough the activity of these brain stem structures. The\\nvestibular system enters the brain stem and influences\\nactivity in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral\\ncortex.\\nThe visual pathway segregates information from the\\ntwo eyes so that one half of the visual field projects to\\nthe other side of the brain. Within visual cortical areas,\\nthe perception of the stimuli and their location is\\npassed along two streams, one ventral and one dorsal.\\nThe ventral visual stream connects to structures in the\\ntemporal lobe that are important for long-term\\nmemory formation. The dorsal visual stream interacts\\nwith the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, and\\ntogether they can influence the activity in the frontal\\nlobe to generate movements of the body in relation to\\nvisual information.\\n14.3 Motor Responses\\nThe motor components of the somatic nervous system\\nbegin with the frontal lobe of the brain, where the\\nprefrontal cortex is responsible for higher functions\\nsuch as working memory. The integrative and associate\\nfunctions of the prefrontal lobe feed into the secondary\\nmotor areas, which help plan movements. The\\npremotor cortex and supplemental motor area then\\nfeed into the primary motor cortex that initiates\\nmovements. Large Betz cells project through the\\ncorticobulbar and corticospinal tracts to synapse on\\nlower motor neurons in the brain stem and ventral horn\\nof the spinal cord, respectively. These connections are\\nresponsible for generating movements of skeletal\\nmuscles.\\nThe extrapyramidal system includes projections from\\nthe brain stem and higher centers that influence\\nmovement, mostly to maintain balance and posture, as\\nwell as to maintain muscle tone. The superior colliculus\\nand red nucleus in the midbrain, the vestibular nuclei in\\nthe medulla, and the reticular formation throughout the\\nbrain stem each have tracts projecting to the spinal\\ncord in this system. Descending input from the\\nsecondary motor cortices, basal nuclei, and cerebellum\\nconnect to the origins of these tracts in the brain stem.\\nAll of these motor pathways project to the spinal cord\\nto synapse with motor neurons in the ventral horn of\\nthe spinal cord. These lower motor neurons are the\\ncells that connect to skeletal muscle and cause\\ncontractions. These neurons project through the spinal\\nnerves to connect to the muscles at neuromuscular\\njunctions. One motor neuron connects to multiple\\nmuscle fibers within a target muscle.

The spread of humans around the world to the\\npresent state of the modern age occurred much more quickly than any species would adapt to environmental\\npressures such as predators. However, the reactions modern humans have in the modern world are based on these\\nprehistoric situations. If your boss is walking down the hallway on Friday afternoon looking for “volunteers” to come\\nin on the weekend, your response is the same as the prehistoric human seeing the lioness running across the\\nsavannah: fight or flight.\\nMost likely, your response to your boss—not to mention the lioness—would be flight. Run away! The autonomic\\nsystem is responsible for the physiological response to make that possible, and hopefully successful. Adrenaline\\nstarts to flood your circulatory system. Your heart rate increases. Sweat glands become active. The bronchi of the\\nlungs dilate to allow more air exchange. Pupils dilate to increase visual information. Blood pressure increases in\\ngeneral, and blood vessels dilate in skeletal muscles. Time to run. Similar physiological responses would occur in\\npreparation for fighting off the threat.\\nThis response should sound a bit familiar. The autonomic nervous system is tied into emotional responses as well,\\nFigure 15.1 Fight or Flight? Though the threats that modern humans face are not large predators, the autonomic nervous system is\\nadapted to this type of stimulus.

In the modern world, these sorts of reactions\\nare associated with anxiety as much as with response to a threat. It is engrained in the nervous system to respond\\nlike this. In fact, the adaptations of the autonomic nervous system probably predate the human species and are\\nlikely to be common to all mammals, and perhaps shared by many animals. That lioness might herself be threatened\\nin some other situation.\\nHowever, the autonomic nervous system is not just about responding to threats. Besides the fight-or-flight\\nresponse, there are the responses referred to as “rest and digest.” If that lioness is successful in her hunting, then\\nshe is going to rest from the exertion. Her heart rate will slow. Breathing will return to normal. The digestive system\\nhas a big job to do. Much of the function of the autonomic system is based on the connections within an autonomic,\\nor visceral, reflex.\\n15.1 Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Name the components that generate the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses of the autonomic\\nnervous system\\n• Explain the differences in output connections within the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system\\n• Describe the signaling molecules and receptor proteins involved in communication within the two divisions of\\nthe autonomic nervous system\\nThe nervous system can be divided into two functional parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic\\nnervous system. The major differences between the two systems are evident in the responses that each produces.\\nThe somatic nervous system causes contraction of skeletal muscles. The autonomic nervous system controls\\ncardiac and smooth muscle, as well as glandular tissue. The somatic nervous system is associated with voluntary\\nresponses (though many can happen without conscious awareness, like breathing), and the autonomic nervous\\nsystem is associated with involuntary responses, such as those related to homeostasis.\\nThe autonomic nervous system regulates many of the internal organs through a balance of two aspects, or divisions.\\nIn addition to the endocrine system, the autonomic nervous system is instrumental in homeostatic mechanisms in\\nthe body. The two divisions of the autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic division and the\\nparasympathetic division. The sympathetic system is associated with the fight-or-flight response, and\\nparasympathetic activity is referred to by the epithet of rest and digest. Homeostasis is the balance between the\\ntwo systems. At each target effector, dual innervation determines activity. For example, the heart receives\\nconnections from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. One causes heart rate to increase, whereas\\nthe other causes heart rate to decrease.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/fightflight) to learn more about adrenaline and the fight-or-flight response.\\nWhen someone is said to have a rush of adrenaline, the image of bungee jumpers or skydivers usually comes to\\nmind. But adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is an important chemical in coordinating the body’s fight-or-flight\\nresponse. In this video, you look inside the physiology of the fight-or-flight response, as envisioned for a firefighter.\\nHis body’s reaction is the result of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system causing system-wide\\nchanges as it prepares for extreme responses. What two changes does adrenaline bring about to help the skeletal\\nmuscle response?\\nSympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System\\nTo respond to a threat—to fight or to run away—the sympathetic system causes divergent effects as many different\\neffector organs are activated together for a common purpose. More oxygen needs to be inhaled and delivered to\\nskeletal muscle. The respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems are all activated together.\\nAdditionally, sweating keeps the excess heat that comes from muscle contraction from causing the body to\\noverheat. The digestive system shuts down so that blood is not absorbing nutrients when it should be delivering\\noxygen to skeletal muscles.

The complex set of structures that compose the output of the sympathetic system make it\\npossible for these disparate effectors to come together in a coordinated, systemic change.\\nThe sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system influences the various organ systems of the body through\\nconnections emerging from the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord. It is referred to as the thoracolumbar\\nsystem to reflect this anatomical basis. A central neuron in the lateral horn of any of these spinal regions projects\\nto ganglia adjacent to the vertebral column through the ventral spinal roots. The majority of ganglia of the\\nsympathetic system belong to a network of sympathetic chain ganglia that runs alongside the vertebral column.\\nThe ganglia appear as a series of clusters of neurons linked by axonal bridges. There are typically 23 ganglia in the\\nchain on either side of the spinal column. Three correspond to the cervical region, 12 are in the thoracic region, four\\nare in the lumbar region, and four correspond to the sacral region. The cervical and sacral levels are not connected\\nto the spinal cord directly through the spinal roots, but through ascending or descending connections through the\\nbridges within the chain.\\nA diagram that shows the connections of the sympathetic system is somewhat like a circuit diagram that shows the\\nelectrical connections between different receptacles and devices. In Figure 15.2, the “circuits” of the sympathetic\\nsystem are intentionally simplified.\\n15.1 • Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System 591'),\n",

Axons from these ganglionic neurons\\n(postganglionic nerve fibers - dotted lines) then project to target effectors throughout the body.\\nTo continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within\\nthe sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain\\nganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated).

This neuron then\\nprojects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated\\naxons.\\nIn some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic\\nfiber emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia\\nsuperior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the\\neye. The spinal nerve tracks up through the chain until it reaches the superior cervical ganglion, where it synapses\\nwith the postganglionic neuron (see Figure 15.3b). The cervical ganglia are referred to as paravertebral ganglia,\\ngiven their location adjacent to prevertebral ganglia in the sympathetic chain.\\nNot all axons from the central neurons terminate in the chain ganglia. Additional branches from the ventral nerve\\nroot continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser\\nsplanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion\\noutside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure\\n15.3c).\\nCollateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive\\ninputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs\\nin the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are\\nthe celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2). The\\nword celiac is derived from the Latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal\\ncavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system.\\n15.1 • Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System 593'),\n",

These cells are\\nneurosecretory cells that develop from the neural crest along with the sympathetic ganglia, reinforcing the idea that\\nthe gland is, functionally, a sympathetic ganglion.\\nThe projections of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system diverge widely, resulting in a broad\\ninfluence of the system throughout the body. As a response to a threat, the sympathetic system would increase\\nheart rate and breathing rate and cause blood flow to the skeletal muscle to increase and blood flow to the digestive\\nsystem to decrease. Sweat gland secretion should also increase as part of an integrated response. All of those\\nphysiological changes are going to be required to occur together to run away from the hunting lioness, or the\\nmodern equivalent. This divergence is seen in the branching patterns of preganglionic sympathetic neurons—a\\nsingle preganglionic sympathetic neuron may have 10–20 targets. An axon that leaves a central neuron of the lateral\\nhorn in the thoracolumbar spinal cord will pass through the white ramus communicans and enter the sympathetic\\nchain, where it will branch toward a variety of targets. At the level of the spinal cord at which the preganglionic\\nsympathetic fiber exits the spinal cord, a branch will synapse on a neuron in the adjacent chain ganglion. Some\\nbranches will extend up or down to a different level of the chain ganglia. Other branches will pass through the chain\\nganglia and project through one of the splanchnic nerves to a collateral ganglion. Finally, some branches may project\\nthrough the splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla. All of these branches mean that one preganglionic neuron\\ncan influence different regions of the sympathetic system very broadly, by acting on widely distributed organs.\\nParasympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System\\nThe parasympathetic system can also be referred to as the craniosacral system (or outflow) because the\\npreganglionic neurons are located in nuclei of the brain stem and the lateral horn of the sacral spinal cord.\\nThe connections, or “circuits,” of the parasympathetic division are similar to the general layout of the sympathetic\\ndivision with a few specific differences (Figure 15.4). The preganglionic fibers from the cranial region travel in cranial\\nnerves, whereas preganglionic fibers from the sacral region travel in spinal nerves. The targets of these fibers are\\nterminal ganglia, which are located near—or even within—the target effector. These ganglia are often referred to as\\nintramural ganglia when they are found within the walls of the target organ. The postganglionic fiber projects from\\nthe terminal ganglia a short distance to the target effector, or to the specific target tissue within the organ.\\nComparing the relative lengths of axons in the parasympathetic system, the preganglionic fibers are long and the\\npostganglionic fibers are short because the ganglia are close to—and sometimes within—the target effectors.\\nThe cranial component of the parasympathetic system is based in particular nuclei of the brain stem. In the\\nmidbrain, the Edinger–Westphal nucleus is part of the oculomotor complex, and axons from those neurons travel\\nwith the fibers in the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) that innervate the extraocular muscles. The preganglionic\\nparasympathetic fibers within cranial nerve III terminate in the ciliary ganglion, which is located in the posterior\\norbit. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers then project to the smooth muscle of the iris to control pupillary\\nsize. In the upper medulla, the salivatory nuclei contain neurons with axons that project through the facial and\\nglossopharyngeal nerves to ganglia that control salivary glands. Tear production is influenced by parasympathetic\\nfibers in the facial nerve, which activate a ganglion, and ultimately the lacrimal (tear) gland. Neurons in the dorsal\\nnucleus of the vagus nerve and the nucleus ambiguus project through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the\\nterminal ganglia of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers primarily influence the\\nheart, bronchi, and esophagus in the thoracic cavity and the stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and small\\nintestine of the abdominal cavity. The postganglionic fibers from the ganglia activated by the vagus nerve are often\\nincorporated into the structure of the organ, such as the mesenteric plexus of the digestive tract organs and the\\nintramural ganglia.\\n15.1 • Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System 595'),\n",

Synapses of the\\nautonomic system are classified as either cholinergic, meaning that acetylcholine (ACh) is released, or adrenergic,\\nmeaning that norepinephrine is released. The terms cholinergic and adrenergic refer not only to the signaling\\nmolecule that is released but also to the class of receptors that each binds.\\nThe cholinergic system includes two classes of receptor: the nicotinic receptor and the muscarinic receptor. Both\\nreceptor types bind to ACh and cause changes in the target cell. The nicotinic receptor is a ligand-gated cation\\nchannel and the muscarinic receptor is a G protein–coupled receptor. The receptors are named for, and\\ndifferentiated by, other molecules that bind to them. Whereas nicotine will bind to the nicotinic receptor, and\\nmuscarine will bind to the muscarinic receptor, there is no cross-reactivity between the receptors. The situation is\\nsimilar to locks and keys. Imagine two locks—one for a classroom and the other for an office—that are opened by\\ntwo separate keys. The classroom key will not open the office door and the office key will not open the classroom\\ndoor. This is similar to the specificity of nicotine and muscarine for their receptors. However, a master key can open\\nmultiple locks, such as a master key for the Biology Department that opens both the classroom and the office doors.\\nThis is similar to ACh that binds to both types of receptors. The molecules that define these receptors are not\\ncrucial—they are simply tools for researchers to use in the laboratory. These molecules are exogenous, meaning\\nthat they are made outside of the human body, so a researcher can use them without any confounding endogenous\\nresults (results caused by the molecules produced in the body).\\nThe adrenergic system also has two types of receptors, named the alpha (α)-adrenergic receptor and beta (β)-\\nadrenergic receptor. Unlike cholinergic receptors, these receptor types are not classified by which drugs can bind\\nto them. All of them are G protein–coupled receptors. There are two types of α-adrenergic receptors, termed α1, and\\nα2, and there are three types of β-adrenergic receptors, termed β1, β2 and β3. An additional aspect of the adrenergic\\nsystem is that there is a second signaling molecule called epinephrine. The chemical difference between\\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine is the addition of a methyl group (CH3) in epinephrine. The prefix “nor-” actually\\nrefers to this chemical difference, in which a methyl group is missing.\\nThe term adrenergic should remind you of the word adrenaline, which is associated with the fight-or-flight response\\ndescribed at the beginning of the chapter. Adrenaline and epinephrine are two names for the same molecule. The\\nadrenal gland (in Latin, ad- = “on top of”; renal = “kidney”) secretes adrenaline. The ending “-ine” refers to the\\nchemical being derived, or extracted, from the adrenal gland. A similar construction from Greek instead of Latin\\nresults in the word epinephrine (epi- = “above”; nephr- = “kidney”). In scientific usage, epinephrine is preferred in\\nthe United States, whereas adrenaline is preferred in Great Britain, because “adrenalin” was once a registered,\\nproprietary drug name in the United States. Though the drug is no longer sold, the convention of referring to this\\nmolecule by the two different names persists. Similarly, norepinephrine and noradrenaline are two names for the\\nsame molecule.\\nHaving understood the cholinergic and adrenergic systems, their role in the autonomic system is relatively simple to\\nunderstand. All preganglionic fibers, both sympathetic and parasympathetic, release ACh. All ganglionic\\nneurons—the targets of these preganglionic fibers—have nicotinic receptors in their cell membranes. The nicotinic\\nreceptor is a ligand-gated cation channel that results in depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. The\\npostganglionic parasympathetic fibers also release ACh, but the receptors on their targets are muscarinic receptors,\\nwhich are G protein–coupled receptors and do not exclusively cause depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.\\nPostganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, except for fibers that project to sweat glands and to\\nblood vessels associated with skeletal muscles, which release ACh (Table 15.1).\\n15.1 • Divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System 597'),\n",

The structure of postganglionic connections are not the typical\\nsynaptic end bulb that is found at the neuromuscular junction, but rather are chains of swellings along the length of\\na postganglionic fiber called a varicosity (Figure 15.5).\\nFIGURE 15.5 Autonomic Varicosities The connection between autonomic fibers and target effectors is not the same as the typical\\nsynapse, such as the neuromuscular junction.

As described in this\\nvideo, the nervous system has a way to deal with threats and stress that is separate from the conscious control of\\nthe somatic nervous system. The system comes from a time when threats were about survival, but in the modern\\nage, these responses become part of stress and anxiety. This video describes how the autonomic system is only part\\nof the response to threats, or stressors. What other organ system gets involved, and what part of the brain\\ncoordinates the two systems for the entire response, including epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol?\\n15.2 Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Compare the structure of somatic and autonomic reflex arcs\\n• Explain the differences in sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes\\n• Differentiate between short and long reflexes\\n• Determine the effect of the autonomic nervous system on the regulation of the various organ systems on the\\nbasis of the signaling molecules involved\\n• Describe the effects of drugs that affect autonomic function\\nThe autonomic nervous system regulates organ systems through circuits that resemble the reflexes described in the\\nsomatic nervous system. The main difference between the somatic and autonomic systems is in what target tissues\\nare effectors. Somatic responses are solely based on skeletal muscle contraction. The autonomic system, however,\\ntargets cardiac and smooth muscle, as well as glandular tissue. Whereas the basic circuit is a reflex arc, there are\\ndifferences in the structure of those reflexes for the somatic and autonomic systems.\\nThe Structure of Reflexes\\nOne difference between a somatic reflex, such as the withdrawal reflex, and a visceral reflex, which is an\\nautonomic reflex, is in the efferent branch. The output of a somatic reflex is the lower motor neuron in the ventral\\nhorn of the spinal cord that projects directly to a skeletal muscle to cause its contraction. The output of a visceral\\nreflex is a two-step pathway starting with the preganglionic fiber emerging from a lateral horn neuron in the spinal\\ncord, or a cranial nucleus neuron in the brain stem, to a ganglion—followed by the postganglionic fiber projecting to a\\ntarget effector. The other part of a reflex, the afferent branch, is often the same between the two systems. Sensory\\nneurons receiving input from the periphery—with cell bodies in the sensory ganglia, either of a cranial nerve or a\\ndorsal root ganglion adjacent to the spinal cord—project into the CNS to initiate the reflex (Figure 15.6). The Latin\\nroot “effere” means “to carry.” Adding the prefix “ef-” suggests the meaning “to carry away,” whereas adding the\\nprefix “af-” suggests “to carry toward or inward.”\\nchapter, would you run or would you stand your ground? Some people would say that they would freeze and not\\nknow what to do. So isn’t there really more to what the autonomic system does than fight, flight, rest, or digest.\\nWhat about fear and paralysis in the face of a threat?\\nThe common epithet of “fight or flight” is being enlarged to be “fight, flight, or fright” or even “fight, flight, fright,\\nor freeze.” Cannon’s original contribution was a catchy phrase to express some of what the nervous system does\\nin response to a threat, but it is incomplete. The sympathetic system is responsible for the physiological\\nresponses to emotional states. The name “sympathetic” can be said to mean that (sym- = “together”; -pathos =\\n“pain,” “suffering,” or “emotion”).\\n15.2 • Autonomic Reflexes and Homeostasis 599'),\n",

Visceral reflexes involve a projection from the central neuron to a ganglion, followed by a second\\nprojection from the ganglion to the target effector.\\nAfferent Branch\\nThe afferent branch of a reflex arc does differ between somatic and visceral reflexes in some instances. Many of the\\ninputs to visceral reflexes are from special or somatic senses, but particular senses are associated with the viscera\\nthat are not part of the conscious perception of the environment through the somatic nervous system. For example,\\nthere is a specific type of mechanoreceptor, called a baroreceptor, in the walls of the aorta and carotid sinuses that\\nsenses the stretch of those organs when blood volume or pressure increases.

If a visceral sense is strong enough, it will be perceived. The sensory homunculus—the\\nrepresentation of the body in the primary somatosensory cortex—only has a small region allotted for the perception\\nof internal stimuli. If you swallow a large bolus of food, for instance, you will probably feel the lump of that food as it\\npushes through your esophagus, or even if your stomach is distended after a large meal. If you inhale especially cold\\nair, you can feel it as it enters your larynx and trachea. These sensations are not the same as feeling high blood\\npressure or blood sugar levels.\\nWhen particularly strong visceral sensations rise to the level of conscious perception, the sensations are often felt in\\nunexpected places. For example, strong visceral sensations of the heart will be felt as pain in the left shoulder and\\nleft arm. This irregular pattern of projection of conscious perception of visceral sensations is called referred pain.\\nDepending on the organ system affected, the referred pain will project to different areas of the body (Figure 15.7).\\nThe location of referred pain is not random, but a definitive explanation of the mechanism has not been established.\\nThe most broadly accepted theory for this phenomenon is that the visceral sensory fibers enter into the same level\\nof the spinal cord as the somatosensory fibers of the referred pain location. By this explanation, the visceral sensory\\nfibers from the mediastinal region, where the heart is located, would enter the spinal cord at the same level as the\\nspinal nerves from the shoulder and arm, so the brain misinterprets the sensations from the mediastinal region as\\nbeing from the axillary and brachial regions.

These connections do not fit with the expected correspondence\\nof visceral and somatosensory fibers entering at the same level of the spinal cord.\\nThe incorrect assumption would be that the visceral sensations are coming from the spleen directly. In fact, the\\nvisceral fibers are coming from the diaphragm. The nerve connecting to the diaphragm takes a special route.

Why would the heart have to beat faster when the\\nteenager changes his body position from lying down to sitting, and then to standing?\\nBalance in Competing Autonomic Reflex Arcs\\nThe autonomic nervous system is important for homeostasis because its two divisions compete at the target\\neffector. The balance of homeostasis is attributable to the competing inputs from the sympathetic and\\nparasympathetic divisions (dual innervation). At the level of the target effector, the signal of which system is sending\\nthe message is strictly chemical. A signaling molecule binds to a receptor that causes changes in the target cell,\\nwhich in turn causes the tissue or organ to respond to the changing conditions of the body.\\nCompeting Neurotransmitters\\nThe postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions both release neurotransmitters that\\nbind to receptors on their targets. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine, with a minor exception,\\nwhereas postganglionic parasympathetic fibers release ACh. For any given target, the difference in which division of\\nthe autonomic nervous system is exerting control is just in what chemical binds to its receptors. The target cells will\\nhave adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. If norepinephrine is released, it will bind to the adrenergic receptors\\npresent on the target cell, and if ACh is released, it will bind to the muscarinic receptors on the target cell.\\nIn the sympathetic system, there are exceptions to this pattern of dual innervation. The postganglionic sympathetic\\nfibers that contact the blood vessels within skeletal muscle and that contact sweat glands do not release\\nnorepinephrine, they release ACh. This does not create any problem because there is no parasympathetic input to\\nthe sweat glands. Sweat glands have muscarinic receptors and produce and secrete sweat in response to the\\npresence of ACh.\\nAt most of the other targets of the autonomic system, the effector response is based on which neurotransmitter is\\nreleased and what receptor is present. For example, regions of the heart that establish heart rate are contacted by\\npostganglionic fibers from both systems. If norepinephrine is released onto those cells, it binds to an adrenergic\\nreceptor that causes the cells to depolarize faster, and the heart rate increases. If ACh is released onto those cells, it\\nbinds to a muscarinic receptor that causes the cells to hyperpolarize so that they cannot reach threshold as easily,\\nand the heart rate slows. Without this parasympathetic input, the heart would work at a rate of approximately 100\\nbeats per minute (bpm). The sympathetic system speeds that up, as it would during exercise, to 120–140 bpm, for\\nexample. The parasympathetic system slows it down to the resting heart rate of 60–80 bpm.\\nAnother example is in the control of pupillary size (Figure 15.9). The afferent branch responds to light hitting the\\nretina. Photoreceptors are activated, and the signal is transferred to the retinal ganglion cells that send an action\\npotential along the optic nerve into the diencephalon. If light levels are low, the sympathetic system sends a signal\\nout through the upper thoracic spinal cord to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic chain. The\\npostganglionic fiber then projects to the iris, where it releases norepinephrine onto the radial fibers of the iris (a\\nsmooth muscle). When those fibers contract, the pupil dilates—increasing the amount of light hitting the retina. If\\nlight levels are too high, the parasympathetic system sends a signal out from the Edinger–Westphal nucleus through\\nthe oculomotor nerve. This fiber synapses in the ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic fiber then\\nprojects to the iris, where it releases ACh onto the circular fibers of the iris—another smooth muscle. When those\\nfibers contract, the pupil constricts to limit the amount of light hitting the retina.\\n604 15 • The Autonomic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

When\\nsomething upsets that balance, the homeostatic mechanisms strive to return it to its regular state. For each organ\\nsystem, there may be more of a sympathetic or parasympathetic tendency to the resting state, which is known as\\nthe autonomic tone of the system. For example, the heart rate was described above. Because the resting heart rate\\nis the result of the parasympathetic system slowing the heart down from its intrinsic rate of 100 bpm, the heart can\\nbe said to be in parasympathetic tone.\\nIn a similar fashion, another aspect of the cardiovascular system is primarily under sympathetic control. Blood\\npressure is partially determined by the contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels. These tissues\\nhave adrenergic receptors that respond to the release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic fibers by\\nconstricting and increasing blood pressure. The hormones released from the adrenal medulla—epinephrine and\\nnorepinephrine—will also bind to these receptors. Those hormones travel through the bloodstream where they can\\neasily interact with the receptors in the vessel walls. The parasympathetic system has no significant input to the\\nsystemic blood vessels, so the sympathetic system determines their tone.\\nThere are a limited number of blood vessels that respond to sympathetic input in a different fashion. Blood vessels\\nin skeletal muscle, particularly those in the lower limbs, are more likely to dilate. It does not have an overall effect\\non blood pressure to alter the tone of the vessels, but rather allows for blood flow to increase for those skeletal\\nmuscles that will be active in the fight-or-flight response. The blood vessels that have a parasympathetic projection\\nare limited to those in the erectile tissue of the reproductive organs. Acetylcholine released by these postganglionic\\nparasympathetic fibers cause the vessels to dilate, leading to the engorgement of the erectile tissue.\\nHOME OSTATIC IMB ALANCE S\\nOrthostatic Hypotension\\nHave you ever stood up quickly and felt dizzy for a moment? This is because, for one reason or another, blood is not\\ngetting to your brain so it is briefly deprived of oxygen. When you change position from sitting or lying down to\\nstanding, your cardiovascular system has to adjust for a new challenge, keeping blood pumping up into the head\\nwhile gravity is pulling more and more blood down into the legs.\\nThe reason for this is a sympathetic reflex that maintains the output of the heart in response to postural change.\\nWhen a person stands up, proprioceptors indicate that the body is changing position. A signal goes to the CNS,\\nwhich then sends a signal to the upper thoracic spinal cord neurons of the sympathetic division. The sympathetic\\nsystem then causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict. Both changes will make it possible\\nfor the cardiovascular system to maintain the rate of blood delivery to the brain. Blood is being pumped superiorly\\nthrough the internal branch of the carotid arteries into the brain, against the force of gravity. Gravity is not increasing\\nwhile standing, but blood is more likely to flow down into the legs as they are extended for standing. This\\nsympathetic reflex keeps the brain well oxygenated so that cognitive and other neural processes are not interrupted.\\nSometimes this does not work properly. If the sympathetic system cannot increase cardiac output, then blood\\npressure into the brain will decrease, and a brief neurological loss can be felt. This can be brief, as a slight\\n“wooziness” when standing up too quickly, or a loss of balance and neurological impairment for a period of time.\\nThe name for this is orthostatic hypotension, which means that blood pressure goes below the homeostatic set\\npoint when standing. It can be the result of standing up faster than the reflex can occur, which may be referred to as\\na benign “head rush,” or it may be the result of an underlying cause.\\nThere are two basic reasons that orthostatic hypotension can occur. First, blood volume is too low and the\\nsympathetic reflex is not effective. This hypovolemia may be the result of dehydration or medications that affect\\nfluid balance, such as diuretics or vasodilators. Both of these medications are meant to lower blood pressure, which\\nmay be necessary in the case of systemic hypertension, and regulation of the medications may alleviate the\\nproblem. Sometimes increasing fluid intake or water retention through salt intake can improve the situation.\\n606 15 • The Autonomic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This is visual sensation, because the afferent branch of this reflex is simply sharing the special sense\\npathway. Bright light hitting the retina leads to the parasympathetic response, through the oculomotor nerve,\\nfollowed by the postganglionic fiber from the ciliary ganglion, which stimulates the circular fibers of the iris to\\ncontract and constrict the pupil. When light hits the retina in one eye, both pupils contract. When that light is\\nremoved, both pupils dilate again back to the resting position. When the stimulus is unilateral (presented to only one\\neye), the response is bilateral (both eyes). The same is not true for somatic reflexes. If you touch a hot radiator, you\\nonly pull that arm back, not both. Central control of autonomic reflexes is different than for somatic reflexes. The\\nhypothalamus, along with other CNS locations, controls the autonomic system.\\nFIGURE 15.10 Pupillary Reflex Pathways The pupil is under competing autonomic control in response to light levels hitting the retina.\\nThe sympathetic system will dilate the pupil when the retina is not receiving enough light, and the parasympathetic system will constrict\\nthe pupil when too much light hits the retina.\\nForebrain Structures\\nAutonomic control is based on the visceral reflexes, composed of the afferent and efferent branches. These\\nhomeostatic mechanisms are based on the balance between the two divisions of the autonomic system, which\\nresults in tone for various organs that is based on the predominant input from the sympathetic or parasympathetic\\nsystems. Coordinating that balance requires integration that begins with forebrain structures like the hypothalamus\\nand continues into the brain stem and spinal cord.\\n15.3 • Central Control 607'),\n",

It regulates both autonomic function\\nand endocrine function. The roles it plays in the pupillary reflexes demonstrates the importance of this control\\ncenter. The optic nerve projects primarily to the thalamus, which is the necessary relay to the occipital cortex for\\nconscious visual perception. Another projection of the optic nerve, however, goes to the hypothalamus.\\nThe hypothalamus then uses this visual system input to drive the pupillary reflexes. If the retina is activated by high\\nlevels of light, the hypothalamus stimulates the parasympathetic response. If the optic nerve message shows that\\nlow levels of light are falling on the retina, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic response. Output from the\\nhypothalamus follows two main tracts, the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus and the medial forebrain bundle (Figure\\n15.11). Along these two tracts, the hypothalamus can influence the Edinger–Westphal nucleus of the oculomotor\\ncomplex or the lateral horns of the thoracic spinal cord.\\nFIGURE 15.11 Fiber Tracts of the Central Autonomic System The hypothalamus is the source of most of the central control of\\nautonomic function. It receives input from cerebral structures and projects to brain stem and spinal cord structures to regulate the balance\\nof sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the organ systems of the body. The main pathways for this are the medial forebrain bundle\\nand the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus.\\nThese two tracts connect the hypothalamus with the major parasympathetic nuclei in the brain stem and the\\npreganglionic (central) neurons of the thoracolumbar spinal cord. The hypothalamus also receives input from other\\nareas of the forebrain through the medial forebrain bundle. The olfactory cortex, the septal nuclei of the basal\\nforebrain, and the amygdala project into the hypothalamus through the medial forebrain bundle. These forebrain\\nstructures inform the hypothalamus about the state of the nervous system and can influence the regulatory\\nprocesses of homeostasis.

For example, when you are anxious or scared, the amygdala will\\nsend signals to the hypothalamus along the medial forebrain bundle that will stimulate the sympathetic fight-or-\\nflight response. The hypothalamus will also stimulate the release of stress hormones through its control of the\\nendocrine system in response to amygdala input.\\nFIGURE 15.12 The Limbic Lobe Structures arranged around the edge of the cerebrum constitute the limbic lobe, which includes the\\namygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus, and connects to the hypothalamus.\\nThe Medulla\\nThe medulla contains nuclei referred to as the cardiovascular center, which controls the smooth and cardiac\\nmuscle of the cardiovascular system through autonomic connections. When the homeostasis of the cardiovascular\\nsystem shifts, such as when blood pressure changes, the coordination of the autonomic system can be\\naccomplished within this region. Furthermore, when descending inputs from the hypothalamus stimulate this area,\\nthe sympathetic system can increase activity in the cardiovascular system, such as in response to anxiety or stress.\\nThe preganglionic sympathetic fibers that are responsible for increasing heart rate are referred to as the cardiac\\naccelerator nerves, whereas the preganglionic sympathetic fibers responsible for constricting blood vessels\\ncompose the vasomotor nerves.\\nSeveral brain stem nuclei are important for the visceral control of major organ systems. One brain stem nucleus\\ninvolved in cardiovascular function is the solitary nucleus. It receives sensory input about blood pressure and\\ncardiac function from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, and its output will activate sympathetic stimulation of\\nthe heart or blood vessels through the upper thoracic lateral horn. Another brain stem nucleus important for visceral\\ncontrol is the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, which is the motor nucleus for the parasympathetic functions\\nascribed to the vagus nerve, including decreasing the heart rate, relaxing bronchial tubes in the lungs, and activating\\ndigestive function through the enteric nervous system.

On the basis of what you have already studied\\nabout autonomic function, which effect would you expect to be associated with parasympathetic, rather than\\nsympathetic, activity?\\n15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• List the classes of pharmaceuticals that interact with the autonomic nervous system\\n• Differentiate between cholinergic and adrenergic compounds\\n• Differentiate between sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs\\n• Relate the consequences of nicotine abuse with respect to autonomic control of the cardiovascular system\\nAn important way to understand the effects of native neurochemicals in the autonomic system is in considering the\\neffects of pharmaceutical drugs. This can be considered in terms of how drugs change autonomic function. These\\neffects will primarily be based on how drugs act at the receptors of the autonomic system neurochemistry. The\\nsignaling molecules of the nervous system interact with proteins in the cell membranes of various target cells. In\\nfact, no effect can be attributed to just the signaling molecules themselves without considering the receptors. A\\nchemical that the body produces to interact with those receptors is called an endogenous chemical, whereas a\\nchemical introduced to the system from outside is an exogenous chemical. Exogenous chemicals may be of a\\nnatural origin, such as a plant extract, or they may be synthetically produced in a pharmaceutical laboratory.\\nBroad Autonomic Effects\\nOne important drug that affects the autonomic system broadly is not a pharmaceutical therapeutic agent associated\\nwith the system. This drug is nicotine. The effects of nicotine on the autonomic nervous system are important in\\nconsidering the role smoking can play in health.\\nAll ganglionic neurons of the autonomic system, in both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, are activated by\\nACh released from preganglionic fibers. The ACh receptors on these neurons are of the nicotinic type, meaning that\\nthey are ligand-gated ion channels. When the neurotransmitter released from the preganglionic fiber binds to the\\nreceptor protein, a channel opens to allow positive ions to cross the cell membrane. The result is depolarization of\\nthe ganglia. Nicotine acts as an ACh analog at these synapses, so when someone takes in the drug, it binds to these\\nACh receptors and activates the ganglionic neurons, causing them to depolarize.\\nGanglia of both divisions are activated equally by the drug. For many target organs in the body, this results in no net\\nchange. The competing inputs to the system cancel each other out and nothing significant happens. For example,\\nthe sympathetic system will cause sphincters in the digestive tract to contract, limiting digestive propulsion, but the\\ndeeper, sweat glands to activate, and the digestive system to suspend activity. These are the same physiological\\nchanges associated with the fight-or-flight response, but there is nothing chasing you on that treadmill.\\nThis is not a simple homeostatic mechanism at work because “maintaining the internal environment” would\\nmean getting all those changes back to their set points. Instead, the sympathetic system has become active\\nduring exercise so that your body can cope with what is happening. A homeostatic mechanism is dealing with\\nthe conscious decision to push the body away from a resting state. The heart, actually, is moving away from its\\nhomeostatic set point. Without any input from the autonomic system, the heart would beat at approximately\\n100 bpm, and the parasympathetic system slows that down to the resting rate of approximately 70 bpm. But in\\nthe middle of a good workout, you should see your heart rate at 120–140 bpm. You could say that the body is\\nstressed because of what you are doing to it. Homeostatic mechanisms are trying to keep blood pH in the\\nnormal range, or to keep body temperature under control, but those are in response to the choice to exercise.\\n610 15 • The Autonomic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The end result is that the food does not really move along and the digestive\\nsystem has not appreciably changed.\\nThe system in which this can be problematic is in the cardiovascular system, which is why smoking is a risk factor for\\ncardiovascular disease. First, there is no significant parasympathetic regulation of blood pressure. Only a limited\\nnumber of blood vessels are affected by parasympathetic input, so nicotine will preferentially cause the vascular\\ntone to become more sympathetic, which means blood pressure will be increased. Second, the autonomic control of\\nthe heart is special. Unlike skeletal or smooth muscles, cardiac muscle is intrinsically active, meaning that it\\ngenerates its own action potentials. The autonomic system does not cause the heart to beat, it just speeds it up\\n(sympathetic) or slows it down (parasympathetic). The mechanisms for this are not mutually exclusive, so the heart\\nreceives conflicting signals, and the rhythm of the heart can be affected (Figure 15.13).\\nFIGURE 15.13 Autonomic Connections to Heart and Blood Vessels The nicotinic receptor is found on all autonomic ganglia, but the\\ncardiovascular connections are particular, and do not conform to the usual competitive projections that would just cancel each other out\\nwhen stimulated by nicotine. The opposing signals to the heart would both depolarize and hyperpolarize the heart cells that establish the\\nrhythm of the heartbeat, likely causing arrhythmia. Only the sympathetic system governs systemic blood pressure so nicotine would cause\\nan increase.\\nSympathetic Effect\\nThe neurochemistry of the sympathetic system is based on the adrenergic system. Norepinephrine and epinephrine\\ninfluence target effectors by binding to the α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that affect the\\nsympathetic system affect these chemical systems. The drugs can be classified by whether they enhance the\\nfunctions of the sympathetic system or interrupt those functions. A drug that enhances adrenergic function is known\\nas a sympathomimetic drug, whereas a drug that interrupts adrenergic function is a sympatholytic drug.\\nSympathomimetic Drugs\\nWhen the sympathetic system is not functioning correctly or the body is in a state of homeostatic imbalance, these\\ndrugs act at postganglionic terminals and synapses in the sympathetic efferent pathway. These drugs either bind to\\n15.4 • Drugs that Affect the Autonomic System 611'),\n",

It can also be\\nused to dilate the pupil and to raise blood pressure. Phenylephrine is known as an α1-adrenergic agonist, meaning\\nthat it binds to a specific adrenergic receptor, stimulating a response. In this role, phenylephrine will bind to the\\nadrenergic receptors in bronchioles of the lungs and cause them to dilate. By opening these structures, accumulated\\nmucus can be cleared out of the lower respiratory tract. Phenylephrine is often paired with other pharmaceuticals,\\nsuch as analgesics, as in the “sinus” version of many over-the-counter drugs, such as Tylenol Sinus® or Excedrin\\nSinus®, or in expectorants for chest congestion such as in Robitussin CF®.\\nA related molecule, called pseudoephedrine, was much more commonly used in these applications than was\\nphenylephrine, until the molecule became useful in the illicit production of amphetamines. Phenylephrine is not as\\neffective as a drug because it can be partially broken down in the digestive tract before it is ever absorbed. Like the\\nadrenergic agents, phenylephrine is effective in dilating the pupil, known as mydriasis (Figure 15.14).\\nPhenylephrine is used during an eye exam in an ophthalmologist’s or optometrist’s office for this purpose. It can\\nalso be used to increase blood pressure in situations in which cardiac function is compromised, such as under\\nanesthesia or during septic shock.\\nFIGURE 15.14 Mydriasis The sympathetic system causes pupillary dilation when norepinephrine binds to an adrenergic receptor in the\\nradial fibers of the iris smooth muscle. Phenylephrine mimics this action by binding to the same receptor when drops are applied onto the\\nsurface of the eye in a doctor’s office. (credit: Corey Theiss / Vulegenda/Wikimedia Commons)\\nOther drugs that enhance adrenergic function are not associated with therapeutic uses, but affect the functions of\\nthe sympathetic system in a similar fashion. Cocaine primarily interferes with the uptake of dopamine at the synapse\\nand can also increase adrenergic function. Caffeine is an antagonist to a different neurotransmitter receptor, called\\nthe adenosine receptor. Adenosine will suppress adrenergic activity, specifically the release of norepinephrine at\\nsynapses, so caffeine indirectly increases adrenergic activity. There is some evidence that caffeine can aid in the\\ntherapeutic use of drugs, perhaps by potentiating (increasing) sympathetic function, as is suggested by the inclusion\\nof caffeine in over-the-counter analgesics such as Excedrin®.\\nSympatholytic Drugs\\nDrugs that interfere with sympathetic function are referred to as sympatholytic, or sympathoplegic, drugs. They\\nprimarily work as an antagonist to the adrenergic receptors. They block the ability of norepinephrine or epinephrine\\nto bind to the receptors so that the effect is “cut” or “takes a blow,” to refer to the endings “-lytic” and “-plegic,”\\nrespectively. The various drugs of this class will be specific to α-adrenergic or β-adrenergic receptors, or to their\\nreceptor subtypes.\\nPossibly the most familiar type of sympatholytic drug are the β-blockers. These drugs are often used to treat\\ncardiovascular disease because they block the β-receptors associated with vasoconstriction and cardioacceleration.\\nBy allowing blood vessels to dilate, or keeping heart rate from increasing, these drugs can improve cardiac function\\nin a compromised system, such as for a person with congestive heart failure or who has previously suffered a heart\\nattack. A couple of common versions of β-blockers are metoprolol, which specifically blocks the β1-receptor, and\\npropanolol, which nonspecifically blocks β-receptors. There are other drugs that are α-blockers and can affect the\\nsympathetic system in a similar way.\\nOther uses for sympatholytic drugs are as antianxiety medications. A common example of this is clonidine, which is\\nan α-agonist. The sympathetic system is tied to anxiety to the point that the sympathetic response can be referred\\n612 15 • The Autonomic Nervous System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers release ACh, and the receptors on the targets are\\nmuscarinic receptors. There are several types of muscarinic receptors, M1–M5, but the drugs are not usually\\nspecific to the specific types. Parasympathetic drugs can be either muscarinic agonists or antagonists, or have\\nindirect effects on the cholinergic system. Drugs that enhance cholinergic effects are called parasympathomimetic\\ndrugs, whereas those that inhibit cholinergic effects are referred to as anticholinergic drugs.\\nPilocarpine is a nonspecific muscarinic agonist commonly used to treat disorders of the eye. It reverses mydriasis,\\nsuch as is caused by phenylephrine, and can be administered after an eye exam. Along with constricting the pupil\\nthrough the smooth muscle of the iris, pilocarpine will also cause the ciliary muscle to contract. This will open\\nperforations at the base of the cornea, allowing for the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior compartment\\nof the eye and, therefore, reducing intraocular pressure related to glaucoma.\\nAtropine and scopolamine are part of a class of muscarinic antagonists that come from the Atropa genus of plants\\nthat include belladonna or deadly nightshade (Figure 15.15). The name of one of these plants, belladonna, refers to\\nthe fact that extracts from this plant were used cosmetically for dilating the pupil. The active chemicals from this\\nplant block the muscarinic receptors in the iris and allow the pupil to dilate, which is considered attractive because\\nit makes the eyes appear larger. Humans are instinctively attracted to anything with larger eyes, which comes from\\nthe fact that the ratio of eye-to-head size is different in infants (or baby animals) and can elicit an emotional\\nresponse. The cosmetic use of belladonna extract was essentially acting on this response. Atropine is no longer\\nused in this cosmetic capacity for reasons related to the other name for the plant, which is deadly nightshade.\\nSuppression of parasympathetic function, especially when it becomes systemic, can be fatal. Autonomic regulation\\nis disrupted and anticholinergic symptoms develop. The berries of this plant are highly toxic, but can be mistaken for\\nother berries. The antidote for atropine or scopolamine poisoning is pilocarpine.\\nFIGURE 15.15 Belladonna Plant The plant from the genus Atropa, which is known as belladonna or deadly nightshade, was used\\ncosmetically to dilate pupils, but can be fatal when ingested.

The key to understanding the autonomic system\\nis to explore the response pathways—the output of the\\nnervous system. The way we respond to the world\\naround us, to manage the internal environment on the\\nbasis of the external environment, is divided between\\ntwo parts of the autonomic nervous system. The\\nsympathetic division responds to threats and produces\\na readiness to confront the threat or to run away: the\\nfight-or-flight response. The parasympathetic division\\nplays the opposite role. When the external environment\\ndoes not present any immediate danger, a restful mode\\ndescends on the body, and the digestive system is\\nmore active.\\nThe sympathetic output of the nervous system\\noriginates out of the lateral horn of the thoracolumbar\\nspinal cord. An axon from one of these central neurons\\nprojects by way of the ventral spinal nerve root and\\nspinal nerve to a sympathetic ganglion, either in the\\nsympathetic chain ganglia or one of the collateral\\nlocations, where it synapses on a ganglionic neuron.\\nThese preganglionic fibers release ACh, which excites\\nthe ganglionic neuron through the nicotinic receptor.\\nThe axon from the ganglionic neuron—the\\npostganglionic fiber—then projects to a target effector\\nwhere it will release norepinephrine to bind to an\\nadrenergic receptor, causing a change in the physiology\\nof that organ in keeping with the broad, divergent\\nsympathetic response. The postganglionic connections\\nto sweat glands in the skin and blood vessels supplying\\nskeletal muscle are, however, exceptions; those fibers\\nrelease ACh onto muscarinic receptors. The\\nsympathetic system has a specialized preganglionic\\nconnection to the adrenal medulla that causes\\nepinephrine and norepinephrine to be released into the\\nbloodstream rather than exciting a neuron that\\ncontacts an organ directly. This hormonal component\\nmeans that the sympathetic chemical signal can\\nspread throughout the body very quickly and affect\\nmany organ systems at once.\\nThe parasympathetic output is based in the brain stem\\nand sacral spinal cord. Neurons from particular nuclei\\nin the brain stem or from the lateral horn of the sacral\\nspinal cord (preganglionic neurons) project to terminal\\n(intramural) ganglia located close to or within the wall\\nof target effectors. These preganglionic fibers also\\nrelease ACh onto nicotinic receptors to excite the\\nganglionic neurons. The postganglionic fibers then\\ncontact the target tissues within the organ to release\\nACh, which binds to muscarinic receptors to induce\\nrest-and-digest responses.\\nSignaling molecules utilized by the autonomic nervous\\nsystem are released from axons and can be considered\\nas either neurotransmitters (when they directly interact\\nwith the effector) or as hormones (when they are\\nreleased into the bloodstream). The same molecule,\\nsuch as norepinephrine, could be considered either a\\nneurotransmitter or a hormone on the basis of whether\\nit is released from a postganglionic sympathetic axon\\nor from the adrenal gland. The synapses in the\\nautonomic system are not always the typical type of\\nconnection first described in the neuromuscular\\njunction. Instead of having synaptic end bulbs at the\\nvery end of an axonal fiber, they may have\\n618 15 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This reflex is similar to the somatic\\nreflex, but the efferent branch is composed of two\\nneurons. The central neuron projects from the spinal\\ncord or brain stem to synapse on the ganglionic neuron\\nthat projects to the effector. The afferent branch of the\\nsomatic and visceral reflexes is very similar, as many\\nsomatic and special senses activate autonomic\\nresponses. However, there are visceral senses that do\\nnot form part of conscious perception. If a visceral\\nsensation, such as cardiac pain, is strong enough, it will\\nrise to the level of consciousness. However, the\\nsensory homunculus does not provide a representation\\nof the internal structures to the same degree as the\\nsurface of the body, so visceral sensations are often\\nexperienced as referred pain, such as feelings of pain\\nin the left shoulder and arm in connection with a heart\\nattack.\\nThe role of visceral reflexes is to maintain a balance of\\nfunction in the organ systems of the body. The two\\ndivisions of the autonomic system each play a role in\\neffecting change, usually in competing directions. The\\nsympathetic system increases heart rate, whereas the\\nparasympathetic system decreases heart rate. The\\nsympathetic system dilates the pupil of the eye,\\nwhereas the parasympathetic system constricts the\\npupil. The competing inputs can contribute to the\\nresting tone of the organ system. Heart rate is normally\\nunder parasympathetic tone, whereas blood pressure\\nis normally under sympathetic tone. The heart rate is\\nslowed by the autonomic system at rest, whereas\\nblood vessels retain a slight constriction at rest.\\nIn a few systems of the body, the competing input from\\nthe two divisions is not the norm. The sympathetic tone\\nof blood vessels is caused by the lack of\\nparasympathetic input to the systemic circulatory\\nsystem. Only certain regions receive parasympathetic\\ninput that relaxes the smooth muscle wall of the blood\\nvessels. Sweat glands are another example, which only\\nreceive input from the sympathetic system.\\n15.3 Central Control\\nThe autonomic system integrates sensory information\\nand higher cognitive processes to generate output,\\nwhich balances homeostatic mechanisms. The central\\nautonomic structure is the hypothalamus, which\\ncoordinates sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent\\npathways to regulate activities of the organ systems of\\nthe body. The majority of hypothalamic output travels\\nthrough the medial forebrain bundle and the dorsal\\nlongitudinal fasciculus to influence brain stem and\\nspinal components of the autonomic nervous system.\\nThe medial forebrain bundle also connects the\\nhypothalamus with higher centers of the limbic system\\nwhere emotion can influence visceral responses. The\\namygdala is a structure within the limbic system that\\ninfluences the hypothalamus in the regulation of the\\nautonomic system, as well as the endocrine system.\\nThese higher centers have descending control of the\\nautonomic system through brain stem centers,\\nprimarily in the medulla, such as the cardiovascular\\ncenter. This collection of medullary nuclei regulates\\ncardiac function, as well as blood pressure. Sensory\\ninput from the heart, aorta, and carotid sinuses project\\nto these regions of the medulla. The solitary nucleus\\nincreases sympathetic tone of the cardiovascular\\nsystem through the cardiac accelerator and vasomotor\\nnerves. The nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal motor\\nnucleus both contribute fibers to the vagus nerve,\\nwhich exerts parasympathetic control of the heart by\\ndecreasing heart rate.\\n15.4 Drugs that Affect the Autonomic\\nSystem\\nThe autonomic system is affected by a number of\\nexogenous agents, including some that are therapeutic\\nand some that are illicit. These drugs affect the\\nautonomic system by mimicking or interfering with the\\nendogenous agents or their receptors. A survey of how\\ndifferent drugs affect autonomic function illustrates the\\nrole that the neurotransmitters and hormones play in\\nautonomic function. Drugs can be thought of as\\nchemical tools to effect changes in the system with\\nsome precision, based on where those drugs are\\neffective.\\nNicotine is not a drug that is used therapeutically,\\nexcept for smoking cessation. When it is introduced\\ninto the body via products, it has broad effects on the\\nautonomic system. Nicotine carries a risk for\\ncardiovascular disease because of these broad effects.\\nThe drug stimulates both sympathetic and\\nparasympathetic ganglia at the preganglionic fiber\\nsynapse. For most organ systems in the body, the\\ncompeting input from the two postganglionic fibers will\\nessentially cancel each other out. However, for the\\ncardiovascular system, the results are different.\\nBecause there is essentially no parasympathetic\\ninfluence on blood pressure for the entire body, the\\nsympathetic input is increased by nicotine, causing an\\n15 • Chapter Review 619'),\n",

Also, the influence that the\\nautonomic system has on the heart is not the same as\\nfor other systems. Other organs have smooth muscle or\\nglandular tissue that is activated or inhibited by the\\nautonomic system. Cardiac muscle is intrinsically\\nactive and is modulated by the autonomic system. The\\ncontradictory signals do not just cancel each other out,\\nthey alter the regularity of the heart rate and can cause\\narrhythmias.

Drugs such as\\nphenylephrine bind to the adrenergic receptors and\\nstimulate target organs just as sympathetic activity\\nwould. Other drugs are sympatholytic because they\\nblock adrenergic activity and cancel the sympathetic\\ninfluence on the target organ. Drugs that act on the\\nparasympathetic system also work by either enhancing\\nthe postganglionic signal or blocking it.

The most likely explanation is that he has suffered a stroke, which has caused a loss of\\noxygen to a particular part of the central nervous system (CNS). The problem is finding where in the entire nervous\\nsystem the stroke has occurred. By checking reflexes, sensory responses, and motor control, a health care provider\\ncan focus on what abilities the patient may have lost as a result of the stroke and can use this information to\\ndetermine where the injury occurred. In the emergency department of the hospital, this kind of rapid assessment of\\nneurological function is key to treating trauma to the nervous system. In the classroom, the neurological exam is a\\nvaluable tool for learning the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system because it allows you to relate the\\nfunctions of the system to particular locations in the nervous system.\\nAs a student of anatomy and physiology, you may be planning to go into an allied health field, perhaps nursing or\\nphysical therapy. You could be in the emergency department treating a patient such as the one just described. An\\nimportant part of this course is to understand the nervous system. This can be especially challenging because you\\nneed to learn about the nervous system using your own nervous system.

A healthcare provider can\\npinpoint problems with the nervous system in minutes by running through the series of tasks to test neurological\\nfunction that are described in this chapter. You can use the same approach, though not as quickly, to learn about\\nneurological function and its relationship to the structures of the nervous system.\\nNervous tissue is different from other tissues in that it is not classified into separate tissue types.

However, not all nervous tissue\\nperforms the same function. Furthermore, specific functions are not wholly localized to individual brain structures in\\nthe way that other bodily functions occur strictly within specific organs. In the CNS, we must consider the\\nconnections between cells over broad areas, not just the function of cells in one particular nucleus or region. In a\\nbroad sense, the nervous system is responsible for the majority of electrochemical signaling in the body, but the use\\nof those signals is different in various regions.\\nThe nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord as the central organs, and the ganglia and nerves as\\norgans in the periphery. The brain and spinal cord can be thought of as a collection of smaller organs, most of which\\nwould be the nuclei (such as the oculomotor nuclei), but white matter structures play an important role (such as the\\ncorpus callosum). Studying the nervous system requires an understanding of the varied physiology of the nervous\\nsystem. For example, the hypothalamus plays a very different role than the visual cortex. The neurological exam\\nprovides a way to elicit behavior that represents those varied functions.\\n16.1 Overview of the Neurological Exam\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• List the major sections of the neurological exam\\n• Explain the connection between location and function in the nervous system\\n• Explain the benefit of a rapid assessment for neurological function in a clinical setting\\n• List the causes of neurological deficits\\n• Describe the different ischemic events in the nervous system\\nThe neurological exam is a clinical assessment tool used to determine what specific parts of the CNS are affected\\nby damage or disease. It can be performed in a short time—sometimes as quickly as 5 minutes—to establish\\nneurological function. In the emergency department, this rapid assessment can make the difference with respect to\\nproper treatment and the extent of recovery that is possible.\\nThe exam is a series of subtests separated into five major sections. The first of these is the mental status exam,\\nwhich assesses the higher cognitive functions such as memory, orientation, and language. Then there is the cranial\\nnerve exam, which tests the function of the 12 cranial nerves and, therefore, the central and peripheral structures\\nassociated with them. The cranial nerve exam tests the sensory and motor functions of each of the nerves, as\\napplicable. Two major sections, the sensory exam and the motor exam, test the sensory and motor functions\\nassociated with spinal nerves. Finally, the coordination exam tests the ability to perform complex and coordinated\\nmovements. The gait exam, which is often considered a sixth major exam, specifically assesses the motor function\\nof walking and can be considered part of the coordination exam because walking is a coordinated movement.\\nNeuroanatomy and the Neurological Exam\\nLocalization of function is the concept that circumscribed locations are responsible for specific functions. The\\nneurological exam highlights this relationship. For example, the cognitive functions that are assessed in the mental\\nstatus exam are based on functions in the cerebrum, mostly in the cerebral cortex. Several of the subtests examine\\nlanguage function. Deficits in neurological function uncovered by these examinations usually point to damage to the\\nleft cerebral cortex. In the majority of individuals, language function is localized to the left hemisphere between the\\nsuperior temporal lobe and the posterior frontal lobe, including the intervening connections through the inferior\\nparietal lobe.\\nThe five major sections of the neurological exam are related to the major regions of the CNS (Figure 16.2). The\\nmental status exam assesses functions related to the cerebrum. The cranial nerve exam is for the nerves that\\nconnect to the diencephalon and brain stem (as well as the olfactory connections to the forebrain). The coordination\\nexam and the related gait exam primarily assess the functions of the cerebellum. The motor and sensory exams are\\nassociated with the spinal cord and its connections through the spinal nerves.\\n626 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Testing the various functions\\nrepresented in the exam allows an accurate estimation of where the nervous system may be damaged. Consider the\\npatient described in the chapter introduction. In the emergency department, he is given a quick exam to find where\\nthe deficit may be localized. Knowledge of where the damage occurred will lead to the most effective therapy.\\nIn rapid succession, he is asked to smile, raise his eyebrows, stick out his tongue, and shrug his shoulders.

The loss of blood flow to part of the brain is known\\nas a stroke, or a cerebrovascular accident (CVA).\\nThere are two main types of stroke, depending on how the blood supply is compromised: ischemic and hemorrhagic.\\nAn ischemic stroke is the loss of blood flow to an area because vessels are blocked or narrowed. This is often\\ncaused by an embolus, which may be a blood clot or fat deposit. Ischemia may also be the result of thickening of the\\nblood vessel wall, or a drop in blood volume in the brain known as hypovolemia.\\nA related type of CVA is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is similar to a stroke although it does not\\nlast as long. The diagnostic definition of a stroke includes effects that last at least 24 hours. Any stroke symptoms\\nthat are resolved within a 24-hour period because of restoration of adequate blood flow are classified as a TIA.\\nA hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding into the brain because of a damaged blood vessel. Accumulated blood fills a\\nregion of the cranial vault and presses against the tissue in the brain (Figure 16.3). Physical pressure on the brain\\ncan cause the loss of function, as well as the squeezing of local arteries resulting in compromised blood flow beyond\\nthe site of the hemorrhage. As blood pools in the nervous tissue and the vasculature is damaged, the blood-brain\\nbarrier can break down and allow additional fluid to accumulate in the region, which is known as edema.\\nFIGURE 16.3 Hemorrhagic Stroke (a) A hemorrhage into the tissue of the cerebrum results in a large accumulation of blood with an\\nadditional edema in the adjacent tissue. The hemorrhagic area causes the entire brain to be disfigured as suggested here by the lateral\\nventricles being squeezed into the opposite hemisphere. (b) A CT scan shows an intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the parietal lobe.\\n(credit b: James Heilman)\\nWhereas hemorrhagic stroke may involve bleeding into a large region of the CNS, such as into the deep white matter\\nof a cerebral hemisphere, other events can cause widespread damage and loss of neurological functions. Infectious\\ndiseases can lead to loss of function throughout the CNS as components of nervous tissue, specifically astrocytes\\nand microglia, react to the disease. Blunt force trauma, such as from a motor vehicle accident, can physically\\ndamage the CNS.\\nA class of disorders that affect the nervous system are the neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer’s disease,\\nParkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeld–Jacob disease, multiple\\nsclerosis (MS), and other disorders that are the result of nervous tissue degeneration. In diseases like Alzheimer’s,\\nParkinson’s, or ALS, neurons die; in diseases like MS, myelin is affected. Some of these disorders affect motor\\nfunction, and others present with dementia. How patients with these disorders perform in the neurological exam\\nvaries, but is often broad in its effects, such as memory deficits that compromise many aspects of the mental status\\nexam, or movement deficits that compromise aspects of the cranial nerve exam, the motor exam, or the\\ncoordination exam. The causes of these disorders are also varied. Some are the result of genetics, such as\\nHuntington’s disease, or the result of autoimmunity, such as MS; others are not entirely understood, such as\\nAlzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Current research suggests that many of these diseases are related in how the\\ndegeneration takes place and may be treated by common therapies.\\n628 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Whether the result of\\ngenetic factors or the environment during development, there are certain situations that result in neurological\\nfunctions being different from the expected norms. Developmental disorders are difficult to define because they are\\ncaused by defects that existed in the past and disrupted the normal development of the CNS. These defects\\nprobably involve multiple environmental and genetic factors—most of the time, we don’t know what the cause is\\nother than that it is more complex than just one factor. Furthermore, each defect on its own may not be a problem,\\nbut when several are added together, they can disrupt growth processes that are not well understand in the first\\nplace. For instance, it is possible for a stroke to damage a specific region of the brain and lead to the loss of the\\nability to recognize faces (prosopagnosia). The link between cell death in the fusiform gyrus and the symptom is\\nrelatively easy to understand. In contrast, similar deficits can be seen in children with the developmental disorder,\\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these children do not lack a fusiform gyrus, nor is there any damage or\\ndefect visible to this brain region. We conclude, rather poorly, that this brain region is not connected properly to\\nother brain regions.\\nInfection, trauma, and congenital disorders can all lead to significant signs, as identified through the neurological\\nexam. It is important to differentiate between an acute event, such as stroke, and a chronic or global condition such\\nas blunt force trauma. Responses seen in the neurological exam can help. A loss of language function observed in all\\nits aspects is more likely a global event as opposed to a discrete loss of one function, such as not being able to say\\ncertain types of words. A concern, however, is that a specific function—such as controlling the muscles of\\nspeech—may mask other language functions.

Ultimately, this is accomplished by assessing behavior. Tremors related to intentional\\nmovements, incoordination, or the neglect of one side of the body can be indicative of failures of the connections of\\nthe cerebrum either within the hemispheres, or from the cerebrum to other portions of the nervous system. There is\\nno strict test for what the cerebrum does alone, but rather in what it does through its control of the rest of the CNS,\\nthe peripheral nervous system (PNS), and the musculature.\\nSometimes eliciting a behavior is as simple as asking a question. Asking a patient to state their name is not only to\\nverify that the file folder in a health care provider’s hands is the correct one, but also to be sure that the patient is\\naware, oriented, and capable of interacting with another person.

The cerebral cortex is the thin\\nlayer of gray matter on the outside of the cerebrum. On average, it is approximately 2.55 mm thick and highly folded\\nto fit within the limited space of the cranial vault. These higher functions are distributed across various regions of\\nthe cortex, and specific locations can be said to be responsible for particular functions. There is a limited set of\\nregions, for example, that are involved in language function, and they can be subdivided on the basis of the\\nparticular part of language function that each governs.\\nThe basis for parceling out areas of the cortex and attributing them to various functions has its root in pure\\nanatomical underpinnings. The German neurologist and histologist Korbinian Brodmann, who made a careful study\\nof the cytoarchitecture of the cerebrum around the turn of the nineteenth century, described approximately 50\\nregions of the cortex that differed enough from each other to be considered separate areas (Figure 16.4). Brodmann\\nmade preparations of many different regions of the cerebral cortex to view with a microscope. He compared the\\nsize, shape, and number of neurons to find anatomical differences in the various parts of the cerebral cortex.\\nContinued investigation into these anatomical areas over the subsequent 100 or more years has demonstrated a\\nstrong correlation between the structures and the functions attributed to those structures. For example, the first\\nthree areas in Brodmann’s list—which are in the postcentral gyrus—compose the primary somatosensory cortex.\\nWithin this area, finer separation can be made on the basis of the concept of the sensory homunculus, as well as the\\ndifferent submodalities of somatosensation such as touch, vibration, pain, temperature, or proprioception. Today,\\nwe more frequently refer to these regions by their function (i.e., primary sensory cortex) than by the number\\nBrodmann assigned to them, but in some situations the use of Brodmann numbers persists.\\nFIGURE 16.4 Brodmann's Areas of the Cerebral Cortex On the basis of cytoarchitecture, the anatomist Korbinian Brodmann\\ndescribed the extensive array of cortical regions, as illustrated in this figure. Subsequent investigations found that these areas\\ncorresponded very well to functional differences in the cerebral cortex. (credit: modification of work by “Looie496”/Wikimedia Commons,\\nbased on original work by Korvinian Brodmann)\\nArea 17, as Brodmann described it, is also known as the primary visual cortex. Adjacent to that are areas 18 and 19,\\nwhich constitute subsequent regions of visual processing. Area 22 is the primary auditory cortex, and it is followed\\nby area 23, which further processes auditory information. Area 4 is the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus,\\nwhereas area 6 is the premotor cortex. These areas suggest some specialization within the cortex for functional\\nprocessing, both in sensory and motor regions. The fact that Brodmann’s areas correlate so closely to functional\\nlocalization in the cerebral cortex demonstrates the strong link between structure and function in these regions.\\nAreas 1, 2, 3, 4, 17, and 22 are each described as primary cortical areas. The adjoining regions are each referred to\\nas association areas. Primary areas are where sensory information is initially received from the thalamus for\\n630 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

The primary cortical areas are where sensory information is initially processed, or where motor\\ncommands emerge to go to the brain stem or spinal cord. Association areas are adjacent to primary areas and further process the modality-\\nspecific input. Multimodal integration areas are found where the modality-specific regions meet; they can process multiple modalities\\ntogether or different modalities on the basis of similar functions, such as spatial processing in vision or somatosensation.\\nA number of other regions, which extend beyond these primary or association areas of the cortex, are referred to as\\nintegrative areas. These areas are found in the spaces between the domains for particular sensory or motor\\nfunctions, and they integrate multisensory information, or process sensory or motor information in more complex\\nways. Consider, for example, the posterior parietal cortex that lies between the somatosensory cortex and visual\\ncortex regions. This has been ascribed to the coordination of visual and motor functions, such as reaching to pick up\\na glass. The somatosensory function that would be part of this is the proprioceptive feedback from moving the arm\\nand hand. The weight of the glass, based on what it contains, will influence how those movements are executed.\\nCognitive Abilities\\nAssessment of cerebral functions is directed at cognitive abilities. The abilities assessed through the mental status\\nexam can be separated into four groups: orientation and memory, language and speech, sensorium, and judgment\\nand abstract reasoning.\\nOrientation and Memory\\nOrientation is the patient’s awareness of their immediate circumstances. It is awareness of time, not in terms of the\\nclock, but of the date and what is occurring around the patient. It is awareness of place, such that a patient should\\nknow where they are and why. It is also awareness of who the patient is—recognizing personal identity and being\\nable to relate that to the examiner. The initial tests of orientation are based on the questions, “Do you know what the\\ndate is?” or “Do you know where you are?” or “What is your name?” Further understanding of a patient’s awareness\\nof orientation can come from questions that address remote memory, such as “Who is the President of the United\\nStates?”, or asking what happened on a specific date.\\nThere are also specific tasks to address memory. One is the three-word recall test. The patient is given three words\\nto recall, such as book, clock, and shovel. After a short interval, during which other parts of the interview continue,\\nthe patient is asked to recall the three words. Other tasks that assess memory—aside from those related to\\norientation—have the patient recite the months of the year in reverse order to avoid the overlearned sequence and\\nfocus on the memory of the months in an order, or to spell common words backwards, or to recite a list of numbers\\nback.\\nMemory is largely a function of the temporal lobe, along with structures beneath the cerebral cortex such as the\\nhippocampus and the amygdala. The storage of memory requires these structures of the medial temporal lobe. A\\n16.2 • The Mental Status Exam 631'),\n",

In 1953, a bilateral lobectomy was performed that alleviated the epilepsy but resulted in the\\ninability for HM to form new memories—a condition called anterograde amnesia. HM was able to recall most events\\nfrom before his surgery, although there was a partial loss of earlier memories, which is referred to as retrograde\\namnesia. HM became the subject of extensive studies into how memory works. What he was unable to do was form\\nnew memories of what happened to him, what are now called episodic memory. Episodic memory is\\nautobiographical in nature, such as remembering riding a bicycle as a child around the neighborhood, as opposed to\\nthe procedural memory of how to ride a bike. HM also retained his short-term memory, such as what is tested by\\nthe three-word task described above. After a brief period, those memories would dissipate or decay and not be\\nstored in the long-term because the medial temporal lobe structures were removed.\\nThe difference in short-term, procedural, and episodic memory, as evidenced by patient HM, suggests that there are\\ndifferent parts of the brain responsible for those functions. The long-term storage of episodic memory requires the\\nhippocampus and related medial temporal structures, and the location of those memories is in the multimodal\\nintegration areas of the cerebral cortex. However, short-term memory—also called working or active memory—is\\nlocalized to the prefrontal lobe. Because patient HM had only lost his medial temporal lobe—and lost very little of his\\nprevious memories, and did not lose the ability to form new short-term memories—it was concluded that the\\nfunction of the hippocampus, and adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe, is to move (or consolidate) short-\\nterm memories (in the pre-frontal lobe) to long-term memory (in the temporal lobe).\\nThe prefrontal cortex can also be tested for the ability to organize information. In one subtest of the mental status\\nexam called set generation, the patient is asked to generate a list of words that all start with the same letter, but not\\nto include proper nouns or names. The expectation is that a person can generate such a list of at least 10 words\\nwithin 1 minute. Many people can likely do this much more quickly, but the standard separates the accepted normal\\nfrom those with compromised prefrontal cortices.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nRead this article (http://openstax.org/l/3word) to learn about a young man who texts his fiancée in a panic as he\\nfinds that he is having trouble remembering things. At the hospital, a neurologist administers the mental status\\nexam, which is mostly normal except for the three-word recall test. The young man could not recall them even 30\\nseconds after hearing them and repeating them back to the doctor. An undiscovered mass in the mediastinum\\nregion was found to be Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system and likely caused\\nantibodies to attack the nervous system. The patient eventually regained his ability to remember, though the events\\nin the hospital were always elusive. Considering that the effects on memory were temporary, but resulted in the loss\\nof the specific events of the hospital stay, what regions of the brain were likely to have been affected by the\\nantibodies and what type of memory does that represent?\\nLanguage and Speech\\nLanguage is, arguably, a very human aspect of neurological function. There are certainly strides being made in\\nunderstanding communication in other species, but much of what makes the human experience seemingly unique is\\nits basis in language. Any understanding of our species is necessarily reflective, as suggested by the question “What\\nam I?” And the fundamental answer to this question is suggested by the famous quote by René Descartes: “Cogito\\nErgo Sum” (translated from Latin as “I think, therefore I am”). Formulating an understanding of yourself is largely\\ndescribing who you are to yourself. It is a confusing topic to delve into, but language is certainly at the core of what it\\nmeans to be self-aware.\\nThe neurological exam has two specific subtests that address language. One measures the ability of the patient to\\nunderstand language by asking them to follow a set of instructions to perform an action, such as “touch your right\\nfinger to your left elbow and then to your right knee.” Another subtest assesses the fluency and coherency of\\nlanguage by having the patient generate descriptions of objects or scenes depicted in drawings, and by reciting\\nsentences or explaining a written passage. Language, however, is important in so many ways in the neurological\\nexam. The patient needs to know what to do, whether it is as simple as explaining how the knee-jerk reflex is going\\n632 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Adjacent\\nto the auditory association cortex, at the end of the lateral sulcus just anterior to the visual cortex, is Wernicke’s\\narea. In the lateral aspect of the frontal lobe, just anterior to the region of the motor cortex associated with the head\\nand neck, is Broca’s area. Both regions were originally described on the basis of losses of speech and language,\\nwhich is called aphasia. The aphasia associated with Broca’s area is known as an expressive aphasia, which means\\nthat speech production is compromised. This type of aphasia is often described as non-fluency because the ability\\nto say some words leads to broken or halting speech. Grammar can also appear to be lost. The aphasia associated\\nwith Wernicke’s area is known as a receptive aphasia, which is not a loss of speech production, but a loss of\\nunderstanding of content. Patients, after recovering from acute forms of this aphasia, report not being able to\\nunderstand what is said to them or what they are saying themselves, but they often cannot keep from talking.\\nThe two regions are connected by white matter tracts that run between the posterior temporal lobe and the lateral\\naspect of the frontal lobe. Conduction aphasia associated with damage to this connection refers to the problem of\\nconnecting the understanding of language to the production of speech. This is a very rare condition, but is likely to\\npresent as an inability to faithfully repeat spoken language.\\nFIGURE 16.6 Broca's and Wernicke's Areas Two important integration areas of the cerebral cortex associated with language function\\nare Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. The two areas are connected through the deep white matter running from the posterior temporal lobe to\\nthe frontal lobe.\\nSensorium\\nThose parts of the brain involved in the reception and interpretation of sensory stimuli are referred to collectively as\\nthe sensorium. The cerebral cortex has several regions that are necessary for sensory perception. From the primary\\ncortical areas of the somatosensory, visual, auditory, and gustatory senses to the association areas that process\\ninformation in these modalities, the cerebral cortex is the seat of conscious sensory perception. In contrast, sensory\\ninformation can also be processed by deeper brain regions, which we may vaguely describe as subconscious—for\\ninstance, we are not constantly aware of the proprioceptive information that the cerebellum uses to maintain\\nbalance. Several of the subtests can reveal activity associated with these sensory modalities, such as being able to\\nhear a question or see a picture. Two subtests assess specific functions of these cortical areas.\\nThe first is praxis, a practical exercise in which the patient performs a task completely on the basis of verbal\\ndescription without any demonstration from the examiner. For example, the patient can be told to take their left\\nhand and place it palm down on their left thigh, then flip it over so the palm is facing up, and then repeat this four\\ntimes. The examiner describes the activity without any movements on their part to suggest how the movements are\\nto be performed. The patient needs to understand the instructions, transform them into movements, and use\\nsensory feedback, both visual and proprioceptive, to perform the movements correctly.\\n16.2 • The Mental Status Exam 633\"),\n",

The first task, known as\\nstereognosis, involves the naming of objects strictly on the basis of the somatosensory information that comes from\\nmanipulating them. The patient keeps their eyes closed and is given a common object, such as a coin, that they have\\nto identify. The patient should be able to indicate the particular type of coin, such as a dime versus a penny, or a\\nnickel versus a quarter, on the basis of the sensory cues involved. For example, the size, thickness, or weight of the\\ncoin may be an indication, or to differentiate the pairs of coins suggested here, the smooth or corrugated edge of the\\ncoin will correspond to the particular denomination. The second task, graphesthesia, is to recognize numbers or\\nletters written on the palm of the hand with a dull pointer, such as a pen cap.\\nPraxis and gnosis are related to the conscious perception and cortical processing of sensory information. Being able\\nto transform verbal commands into a sequence of motor responses, or to manipulate and recognize a common\\nobject and associate it with a name for that object. Both subtests have language components because language\\nfunction is integral to these functions. The relationship between the words that describe actions, or the nouns that\\nrepresent objects, and the cerebral location of these concepts is suggested to be localized to particular cortical\\nareas. Certain aphasias can be characterized by a deficit of verbs or nouns, known as V impairment or N impairment,\\nor may be classified as V–N dissociation. Patients have difficulty using one type of word over the other. To describe\\nwhat is happening in a photograph as part of the expressive language subtest, a patient will use active- or image-\\nbased language. The lack of one or the other of these components of language can relate to the ability to use verbs\\nor nouns. Damage to the region at which the frontal and temporal lobes meet, including the region known as the\\ninsula, is associated with V impairment; damage to the middle and inferior temporal lobe is associated with N\\nimpairment.\\nJudgment and Abstract Reasoning\\nPlanning and producing responses requires an ability to make sense of the world around us. Making judgments and\\nreasoning in the abstract are necessary to produce movements as part of larger responses. For example, when your\\nalarm goes off, do you hit the snooze button or jump out of bed? Is 10 extra minutes in bed worth the extra rush to\\nget ready for your day? Will hitting the snooze button multiple times lead to feeling more rested or result in a panic\\nas you run late? How you mentally process these questions can affect your whole day.\\nThe prefrontal cortex is responsible for the functions responsible for planning and making decisions. In the mental\\nstatus exam, the subtest that assesses judgment and reasoning is directed at three aspects of frontal lobe function.\\nFirst, the examiner asks questions about problem solving, such as “If you see a house on fire, what would you do?”\\nThe patient is also asked to interpret common proverbs, such as “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” Additionally,\\npairs of words are compared for similarities, such as apple and orange, or lamp and cabinet.\\nThe prefrontal cortex is composed of the regions of the frontal lobe that are not directly related to specific motor\\nfunctions. The most posterior region of the frontal lobe, the precentral gyrus, is the primary motor cortex. Anterior to\\nthat are the premotor cortex, Broca’s area, and the frontal eye fields, which are all related to planning certain types\\nof movements. Anterior to what could be described as motor association areas are the regions of the prefrontal\\ncortex. They are the regions in which judgment, abstract reasoning, and working memory are localized. The\\nantecedents to planning certain movements are judging whether those movements should be made, as in the\\nexample of deciding whether to hit the snooze button.\\nTo an extent, the prefrontal cortex may be related to personality. The neurological exam does not necessarily assess\\npersonality, but it can be within the realm of neurology or psychiatry. A clinical situation that suggests this link\\nbetween the prefrontal cortex and personality comes from the story of Phineas Gage, the railroad worker from the\\nmid-1800s who had a metal spike impale his prefrontal cortex. There are suggestions that the steel rod led to\\nchanges in his personality. A man who was a quiet, dependable railroad worker became a raucous, irritable\\ndrunkard. Later anecdotal evidence from his life suggests that he was able to support himself, although he had to\\nrelocate and take on a different career as a stagecoach driver.\\nA psychiatric practice to deal with various disorders was the prefrontal lobotomy. This procedure was common in\\nthe 1940s and early 1950s, until antipsychotic drugs became available. The connections between the prefrontal\\ncortex and other regions of the brain were severed. The disorders associated with this procedure included some\\naspects of what are now referred to as personality disorders, but also included mood disorders and psychoses.\\nDepictions of lobotomies in popular media suggest a link between cutting the white matter of the prefrontal cortex\\n634 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

A few tests are run to demonstrate how this manifests in tests of cerebral function. Unlike\\nnormal people, this patient can perform two independent tasks at the same time because the lines of\\ncommunication between the right and left sides of his brain have been removed. Whereas a person with an intact\\ncorpus callosum cannot overcome the dominance of one hemisphere over the other, this patient can. If the left\\ncerebral hemisphere is dominant in the majority of people, why would right-handedness be most common?\\n16.3 The Cranial Nerve Exam\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the functional grouping of cranial nerves\\n• Match the regions of the forebrain and brain stem that are connected to each cranial nerve\\n• Suggest diagnoses that would explain certain losses of function in the cranial nerves\\n• Relate cranial nerve deficits to damage of adjacent, unrelated structures\\nThe twelve cranial nerves are typically covered in introductory anatomy courses, and memorizing their names is\\nfacilitated by numerous mnemonics developed by students over the years of this practice. But knowing the names\\nof the nerves in order often leaves much to be desired in understanding what the nerves do. The nerves can be\\ncategorized by functions, and subtests of the cranial nerve exam can clarify these functional groupings.\\nThree of the nerves are strictly responsible for special senses whereas four others contain fibers for special and\\ngeneral senses. Three nerves are connected to the extraocular muscles resulting in the control of gaze. Four nerves\\nEveryday Connection\\nLeft Brain, Right Brain\\nPopular media often refer to right-brained and left-brained people, as if the brain were two independent halves\\nthat work differently for different people. This is a popular misinterpretation of an important neurological\\nphenomenon. As an extreme measure to deal with a debilitating condition, the corpus callosum may be\\nsectioned to overcome intractable epilepsy. When the connections between the two cerebral hemispheres are\\ncut, interesting effects can be observed.\\nIf a person with an intact corpus callosum is asked to put their hands in their pockets and describe what is there\\non the basis of what their hands feel, they might say that they have keys in their right pocket and loose change in\\nthe left. They may even be able to count the coins in their pocket and say if they can afford to buy a candy bar\\nfrom the vending machine. If a person with a sectioned corpus callosum is given the same instructions, they will\\ndo something quite peculiar. They will only put their right hand in their pocket and say they have keys there.\\nThey will not even move their left hand, much less report that there is loose change in the left pocket.\\nThe reason for this is that the language functions of the cerebral cortex are localized to the left hemisphere in 95\\npercent of the population. Additionally, the left hemisphere is connected to the right side of the body through\\nthe corticospinal tract and the ascending tracts of the spinal cord. Motor commands from the precentral gyrus\\ncontrol the opposite side of the body, whereas sensory information processed by the postcentral gyrus is\\nreceived from the opposite side of the body. For a verbal command to initiate movement of the right arm and\\nhand, the left side of the brain needs to be connected by the corpus callosum. Language is processed in the left\\nside of the brain and directly influences the left brain and right arm motor functions, but is sent to influence the\\nright brain and left arm motor functions through the corpus callosum. Likewise, the left-handed sensory\\nperception of what is in the left pocket travels across the corpus callosum from the right brain, so no verbal\\nreport on those contents would be possible if the hand happened to be in the pocket.\\n16.3 • The Cranial Nerve Exam 635'),\n",

Four nerves make up the cranial component of the parasympathetic nervous system responsible for\\npupillary constriction, salivation, and the regulation of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities.\\nFinally, one nerve controls the muscles of the neck, assisting with spinal control of the movement of the head and\\nneck.\\nThe cranial nerve exam allows directed tests of forebrain and brain stem structures. The twelve cranial nerves serve\\nthe head and neck. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) has autonomic functions in the thoracic and superior\\nabdominal cavities. The special senses are served through the cranial nerves, as well as the general senses of the\\nhead and neck. The movement of the eyes, face, tongue, throat, and neck are all under the control of cranial nerves.\\nPreganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers that control pupillary size, salivary glands, and the thoracic and upper\\nabdominal viscera are found in four of the nerves. Tests of these functions can provide insight into damage to\\nspecific regions of the brain stem and may uncover deficits in adjacent regions.\\nSensory Nerves\\nThe olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves (cranial nerves I, II, and VIII) are dedicated to four of the special\\nsenses: smell, vision, equilibrium, and hearing, respectively. Taste sensation is relayed to the brain stem through\\nfibers of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. The trigeminal nerve is a mixed nerve that carries the general\\nsomatic senses from the head, similar to those coming through spinal nerves from the rest of the body.\\nTesting smell is straightforward, as common smells are presented to one nostril at a time. The patient should be\\nable to recognize the smell of coffee or mint, indicating the proper functioning of the olfactory system. Loss of the\\nsense of smell is called anosmia and can be lost following blunt trauma to the head or through aging. The short\\naxons of the first cranial nerve regenerate on a regular basis. The neurons in the olfactory epithelium have a limited\\nlife span, and new cells grow to replace the ones that die off. The axons from these neurons grow back into the CNS\\nby following the existing axons—representing one of the few examples of such growth in the mature nervous system.\\nIf all of the fibers are sheared when the brain moves within the cranium, such as in a motor vehicle accident, then no\\naxons can find their way back to the olfactory bulb to re-establish connections. If the nerve is not completely\\nsevered, the anosmia may be temporary as new neurons can eventually reconnect.\\nOlfaction is not the pre-eminent sense, but its loss can be quite detrimental. The enjoyment of food is largely based\\non our sense of smell. Anosmia means that food will not seem to have the same taste, though the gustatory sense is\\nintact, and food will often be described as being bland. However, the taste of food can be improved by adding\\ningredients (e.g., salt) that stimulate the gustatory sense.\\nTesting vision relies on the tests that are common in an optometry office. The Snellen chart (Figure 16.7)\\ndemonstrates visual acuity by presenting standard Roman letters in a variety of sizes. The result of this test is a\\nrough generalization of the acuity of a person based on the normal accepted acuity, such that a letter that subtends\\na visual angle of 5 minutes of an arc at 20 feet can be seen. To have 20/60 vision, for example, means that the\\nsmallest letters that a person can see at a 20-foot distance could be seen by a person with normal acuity from 60\\nfeet away. Testing the extent of the visual field means that the examiner can establish the boundaries of peripheral\\nvision as simply as holding their hands out to either side and asking the patient when the fingers are no longer\\nvisible without moving the eyes to track them. If it is necessary, further tests can establish the perceptions in the\\nvisual fields. Physical inspection of the optic disk, or where the optic nerve emerges from the eye, can be\\naccomplished by looking through the pupil with an ophthalmoscope.\\n636 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The line with letters that subtend 5 minutes of an arc from 20 feet represents the smallest letters that a person with normal acuity\\nshould be able to read at that distance. The different sizes of letters in the other lines represent rough approximations of what a person of\\nnormal acuity can read at different distances. For example, the line that represents 20/200 vision would have larger letters so that they are\\nlegible to the person with normal acuity at 200 feet.\\nThe optic nerves from both sides enter the cranium through the respective optic canals and meet at the optic\\nchiasm at which fibers sort such that the two halves of the visual field are processed by the opposite sides of the\\nbrain. Deficits in visual field perception often suggest damage along the length of the optic pathway between the\\norbit and the diencephalon. For example, loss of peripheral vision may be the result of a pituitary tumor pressing on\\nthe optic chiasm (Figure 16.8). The pituitary, seated in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone, is directly inferior to\\nthe optic chiasm. The axons that decussate in the chiasm are from the medial retinae of either eye, and therefore\\ncarry information from the peripheral visual field.\\nFIGURE 16.8 Pituitary Tumor The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone within the cranial floor, placing it\\nimmediately inferior to the optic chiasm.

Though the two senses are not directly related, anatomy is mirrored in the two systems. Problems with\\nbalance, such as vertigo, and deficits in hearing may both point to problems with the inner ear. Within the petrous\\nregion of the temporal bone is the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. The vestibule is the portion for equilibrium,\\ncomposed of the utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals. The cochlea is responsible for transducing\\nsound waves into a neural signal. The sensory nerves from these two structures travel side-by-side as the\\nvestibulocochlear nerve, though they are really separate divisions. They both emerge from the inner ear, pass\\nthrough the internal auditory meatus, and synapse in nuclei of the superior medulla. Though they are part of distinct\\nsensory systems, the vestibular nuclei and the cochlear nuclei are close neighbors with adjacent inputs. Deficits in\\none or both systems could occur from damage that encompasses structures close to both. Damage to structures\\nnear the two nuclei can result in deficits to one or both systems.\\nBalance or hearing deficits may be the result of damage to the middle or inner ear structures. Ménière's disease is a\\ndisorder that can affect both equilibrium and audition in a variety of ways. The patient can suffer from vertigo, a low-\\nfrequency ringing in the ears, or a loss of hearing. From patient to patient, the exact presentation of the disease can\\nbe different. Additionally, within a single patient, the symptoms and signs may change as the disease progresses.\\nUse of the neurological exam subtests for the vestibulocochlear nerve illuminates the changes a patient may go\\nthrough. The disease appears to be the result of accumulation, or over-production, of fluid in the inner ear, in either\\nthe vestibule or cochlea.\\nTests of equilibrium are important for coordination and gait and are related to other aspects of the neurological\\nexam. The vestibulo-ocular reflex involves the cranial nerves for gaze control. Balance and equilibrium, as tested by\\nthe Romberg test, are part of spinal and cerebellar processes and involved in those components of the neurological\\nexam, as discussed later.\\nHearing is tested by using a tuning fork in a couple of different ways. The Rinne test involves using a tuning fork to\\ndistinguish between conductive hearing and sensorineural hearing. Conductive hearing relies on vibrations being\\nconducted through the ossicles of the middle ear. Sensorineural hearing is the transmission of sound stimuli through\\nthe neural components of the inner ear and cranial nerve. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process\\nand the patient indicates when the sound produced from this is no longer present. Then the fork is immediately\\nmoved to just next to the ear canal so the sound travels through the air. If the sound is not heard through the ear,\\nmeaning the sound is conducted better through the temporal bone than through the ossicles, a conductive hearing\\ndeficit is present. The Weber test also uses a tuning fork to differentiate between conductive versus sensorineural\\nhearing loss. In this test, the tuning fork is placed at the top of the skull, and the sound of the tuning fork reaches\\nboth inner ears by travelling through bone. In a healthy patient, the sound would appear equally loud in both ears.\\nWith unilateral conductive hearing loss, however, the tuning fork sounds louder in the ear with hearing loss. This is\\nbecause the sound of the tuning fork has to compete with background noise coming from the outer ear, but in\\nconductive hearing loss, the background noise is blocked in the damaged ear, allowing the tuning fork to sound\\nrelatively louder in that ear. With unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, however, damage to the cochlea or\\nassociated nervous tissue means that the tuning fork sounds quieter in that ear.\\nThe trigeminal system of the head and neck is the equivalent of the ascending spinal cord systems of the dorsal\\ncolumn and the spinothalamic pathways. Somatosensation of the face is conveyed along the nerve to enter the brain\\nstem at the level of the pons. Synapses of those axons, however, are distributed across nuclei found throughout the\\nbrain stem. The mesencephalic nucleus processes proprioceptive information of the face, which is the movement\\nand position of facial muscles. It is the sensory component of the jaw-jerk reflex, a stretch reflex of the masseter\\nmuscle. The chief nucleus, located in the pons, receives information about light touch as well as proprioceptive\\ninformation about the mandible, which are both relayed to the thalamus and, ultimately, to the postcentral gyrus of\\nthe parietal lobe. The spinal trigeminal nucleus, located in the medulla, receives information about crude touch,\\npain, and temperature to be relayed to the thalamus and cortex. Essentially, the projection through the chief nucleus\\nis analogous to the dorsal column pathway for the body, and the projection through the spinal trigeminal nucleus is\\nanalogous to the spinothalamic pathway.\\nSubtests for the sensory component of the trigeminal system are the same as those for the sensory exam targeting\\n638 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

The primary sensory subtest for the trigeminal system is sensory discrimination. A cotton-tipped\\napplicator, which is cotton attached to the end of a thin wooden stick, can be used easily for this. The wood of the\\napplicator can be snapped so that a pointed end is opposite the soft cotton-tipped end. The cotton end provides a\\ntouch stimulus, while the pointed end provides a painful, or sharp, stimulus. While the patient’s eyes are closed, the\\nexaminer touches the two ends of the applicator to the patient’s face, alternating randomly between them. The\\npatient must identify whether the stimulus is sharp or dull. These stimuli are processed by the trigeminal system\\nseparately. Contact with the cotton tip of the applicator is a light touch, relayed by the chief nucleus, but contact\\nwith the pointed end of the applicator is a painful stimulus relayed by the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Failure to\\ndiscriminate these stimuli can localize problems within the brain stem. If a patient cannot recognize a painful\\nstimulus, that might indicate damage to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the medulla. The medulla also contains\\nimportant regions that regulate the cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems, as well as being the pathway\\nfor ascending and descending tracts between the brain and spinal cord. Damage, such as a stroke, that results in\\nchanges in sensory discrimination may indicate these unrelated regions are affected as well.\\nGaze Control\\nThe three nerves that control the extraocular muscles are the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which\\nare the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. As the name suggests, the abducens nerve is responsible for\\nabducting the eye, which it controls through contraction of the lateral rectus muscle. The trochlear nerve controls\\nthe superior oblique muscle to rotate the eye along its axis in the orbit medially, which is called intorsion, and is a\\ncomponent of focusing the eyes on an object close to the face. The oculomotor nerve controls all the other\\nextraocular muscles, as well as a muscle of the upper eyelid. Movements of the two eyes need to be coordinated to\\nlocate and track visual stimuli accurately. When moving the eyes to locate an object in the horizontal plane, or to\\ntrack movement horizontally in the visual field, the lateral rectus muscle of one eye and medial rectus muscle of the\\nother eye are both active. The lateral rectus is controlled by neurons of the abducens nucleus in the superior\\nmedulla, whereas the medial rectus is controlled by neurons in the oculomotor nucleus of the midbrain.\\nCoordinated movement of both eyes through different nuclei requires integrated processing through the brain stem.\\nIn the midbrain, the superior colliculus integrates visual stimuli with motor responses to initiate eye movements.\\nThe paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) will initiate a rapid eye movement, or saccade, to bring the\\neyes to bear on a visual stimulus quickly. These areas are connected to the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens\\nnuclei by the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) that runs through the majority of the brain stem. The MLF allows\\nfor conjugate gaze, or the movement of the eyes in the same direction, during horizontal movements that require\\nthe lateral and medial rectus muscles. Control of conjugate gaze strictly in the vertical direction is contained within\\nthe oculomotor complex. To elevate the eyes, the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both\\nsuperior rectus muscles; to depress the eyes, the oculomotor nerve on either side stimulates the contraction of both\\ninferior rectus muscles.\\nPurely vertical movements of the eyes are not very common. Movements are often at an angle, so some horizontal\\ncomponents are necessary, adding the medial and lateral rectus muscles to the movement. The rapid movement of\\nthe eyes used to locate and direct the fovea onto visual stimuli is called a saccade. Notice that the paths that are\\ntraced in Figure 16.9 are not strictly vertical. The movements between the nose and the mouth are closest, but still\\nhave a slant to them. Also, the superior and inferior rectus muscles are not perfectly oriented with the line of sight.\\nThe origin for both muscles is medial to their insertions, so elevation and depression may require the lateral rectus\\nmuscles to compensate for the slight adduction inherent in the contraction of those muscles, requiring MLF activity\\nas well.\\n16.3 • The Cranial Nerve Exam 639'),\n",

This image represents the shifts in gaze typical of a person studying a face. Notice the concentration\\nof gaze on the major features of the face and the large number of paths traced between the eyes or around the mouth.\\nTesting eye movement is simply a matter of having the patient track the tip of a pen as it is passed through the visual\\nfield. This may appear similar to testing visual field deficits related to the optic nerve, but the difference is that the\\npatient is asked to not move the eyes while the examiner moves a stimulus into the peripheral visual field. Here, the\\nextent of movement is the point of the test. The examiner is watching for conjugate movements representing proper\\nfunction of the related nuclei and the MLF. Failure of one eye to abduct while the other adducts in a horizontal\\nmovement is referred to as internuclear ophthalmoplegia. When this occurs, the patient will experience diplopia,\\nor double vision, as the two eyes are temporarily pointed at different stimuli. Diplopia is not restricted to failure of\\nthe lateral rectus, because any of the extraocular muscles may fail to move one eye in perfect conjugation with the\\nother.\\nThe final aspect of testing eye movements is to move the tip of the pen in toward the patient’s face. As visual stimuli\\nmove closer to the face, the two medial recti muscles cause the eyes to move in the one nonconjugate movement\\nthat is part of gaze control. When the two eyes move to look at something closer to the face, they both adduct, which\\nis referred to as convergence. To keep the stimulus in focus, the eye also needs to change the shape of the lens,\\nwhich is controlled through the parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve. The change in focal power of the\\neye is referred to as accommodation. Accommodation ability changes with age; focusing on nearer objects, such as\\nthe written text of a book or on a computer screen, may require corrective lenses later in life. Coordination of the\\nskeletal muscles for convergence and coordination of the smooth muscles of the ciliary body for accommodation are\\nreferred to as the accommodation–convergence reflex.\\nA crucial function of the cranial nerves is to keep visual stimuli centered on the fovea of the retina. The vestibulo-\\nocular reflex (VOR) coordinates all of the components (Figure 16.10), both sensory and motor, that make this\\npossible. If the head rotates in one direction—for example, to the right—the horizontal pair of semicircular canals in\\nthe inner ear indicate the movement by increased activity on the right and decreased activity on the left. The\\ninformation is sent to the abducens nuclei and oculomotor nuclei on either side to coordinate the lateral and medial\\nrectus muscles.

These actions stabilize the visual field by compensating\\nfor the head rotation with opposite rotation of the eyes in the orbits. Deficits in the VOR may be related to vestibular\\ndamage, such as in Ménière’s disease, or from dorsal brain stem damage that would affect the eye movement nuclei\\nor their connections through the MLF.\\nFIGURE 16.10 Vestibulo-ocular Reflex If the head is turned in one direction, the coordination of that movement with the fixation of the\\neyes on a visual stimulus involves a circuit that ties the vestibular sense with the eye movement nuclei through the MLF.\\nNerves of the Face and Oral Cavity\\nAn iconic part of a doctor’s visit is the inspection of the oral cavity and pharynx, suggested by the directive to “open\\nyour mouth and say ‘ah.’” This is followed by inspection, with the aid of a tongue depressor, of the back of the\\nmouth, or the opening of the oral cavity into the pharynx known as the fauces. Whereas this portion of a medical\\nexam inspects for signs of infection, such as in tonsillitis, it is also the means to test the functions of the cranial\\nnerves that are associated with the oral cavity.\\nThe facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the brain. Testing this is as simple as\\nintroducing salty, sour, bitter, or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue. The patient should respond to the taste\\nstimulus before retracting the tongue into the mouth. Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve\\ninto the saliva and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the left or right of the nerves, masking any lateral\\ndeficits. Along with taste, the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the pharyngeal walls. These\\nsensations, along with certain taste stimuli, can stimulate the gag reflex. If the examiner moves the tongue\\ndepressor to contact the lateral wall of the fauces, this should elicit the gag reflex. Stimulation of either side of the\\nfauces should elicit an equivalent response. The motor response, through contraction of the muscles of the pharynx,\\nis mediated through the vagus nerve. Normally, the vagus nerve is considered autonomic in nature. The vagus nerve\\ndirectly stimulates the contraction of skeletal muscles in the pharynx and larynx to contribute to the swallowing and\\nspeech functions. Further testing of vagus motor function has the patient repeating consonant sounds that require\\n16.3 • The Cranial Nerve Exam 641'),\n",

The patient is asked to say “lah-kah-pah” or a similar set of alternating\\nsounds while the examiner observes the movements of the soft palate and arches between the palate and tongue.\\nThe facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are also responsible for the initiation of salivation. Neurons in the salivary\\nnuclei of the medulla project through these two nerves as preganglionic fibers, and synapse in ganglia located in the\\nhead. The parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, which projects to the\\nsubmandibular gland and sublingual gland. The parasympathetic fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in\\nthe otic ganglion, which projects to the parotid gland. Salivation in response to food in the oral cavity is based on a\\nvisceral reflex arc within the facial or glossopharyngeal nerves. Other stimuli that stimulate salivation are\\ncoordinated through the hypothalamus, such as the smell and sight of food.\\nThe hypoglossal nerve is the motor nerve that controls the muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus\\nmuscle, which is controlled by the vagus nerve. There are two sets of muscles of the tongue. The extrinsic muscles\\nof the tongue are connected to other structures, whereas the intrinsic muscles of the tongue are completely\\ncontained within the lingual tissues. While examining the oral cavity, movement of the tongue will indicate whether\\nhypoglossal function is impaired. The test for hypoglossal function is the “stick out your tongue” part of the exam.\\nThe genioglossus muscle is responsible for protrusion of the tongue. If the hypoglossal nerves on both sides are\\nworking properly, then the tongue will stick straight out. If the nerve on one side has a deficit, the tongue will stick\\nout to that side—pointing to the side with damage. Loss of function of the tongue can interfere with speech and\\nswallowing. Additionally, because the location of the hypoglossal nerve and nucleus is near the cardiovascular\\ncenter, inspiratory and expiratory areas for respiration, and the vagus nuclei that regulate digestive functions, a\\ntongue that protrudes incorrectly can suggest damage in adjacent structures that have nothing to do with controlling\\nthe tongue.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nWatch this short video (http://openstax.org/l/facialnerve) to see an examination of the facial nerve using some\\nsimple tests. The facial nerve controls the muscles of facial expression. Severe deficits will be obvious in watching\\nsomeone use those muscles for normal control. One side of the face might not move like the other side. But directed\\ntests, especially for contraction against resistance, require a formal testing of the muscles. The muscles of the upper\\nand lower face need to be tested. The strength test in this video involves the patient squeezing her eyes shut and\\nthe examiner trying to pry her eyes open. Why does the examiner ask her to try a second time?\\nMotor Nerves of the Neck\\nThe accessory nerve, also referred to as the spinal accessory nerve, innervates the sternocleidomastoid and\\ntrapezius muscles (Figure 16.11). When both the sternocleidomastoids contract, the head flexes forward;\\nindividually, they cause rotation to the opposite side. The trapezius can act as an antagonist, causing extension and\\nhyperextension of the neck. These two superficial muscles are important for changing the position of the head. Both\\nmuscles also receive input from cervical spinal nerves. Along with the spinal accessory nerve, these nerves\\ncontribute to elevating the scapula and clavicle through the trapezius, which is tested by asking the patient to shrug\\nboth shoulders, and watching for asymmetry. For the sternocleidomastoid, those spinal nerves are primarily sensory\\nprojections, whereas the trapezius also has lateral insertions to the clavicle and scapula, and receives motor input\\nfrom the spinal cord. Calling the nerve the spinal accessory nerve suggests that it is aiding the spinal nerves. Though\\nthat is not precisely how the name originated, it does help make the association between the function of this nerve\\nin controlling these muscles and the role these muscles play in movements of the trunk or shoulders.\\n642 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Lateral flexion of the neck toward the shoulder tests both at the same time. Any\\ndifference on one side versus the other would suggest damage on the weaker side.

When light hits the retina, specialized photosensitive\\nganglion cells send a signal along the optic nerve to the pretectal nucleus in the superior midbrain. A neuron from\\nthis nucleus projects to the Edinger–Westphal nuclei in the oculomotor complex in both sides of the midbrain.\\nNeurons in this nucleus give rise to the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that project through the oculomotor\\nnerve to the ciliary ganglion in the posterior orbit. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ganglion\\nproject to the iris, where they release acetylcholine onto circular fibers that constrict the pupil to reduce the amount\\nof light hitting the retina. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for dilating the pupil when light levels are\\nlow.\\nShining light in one eye will elicit constriction of both pupils. The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is bilateral.\\nLight shined in one eye causes a constriction of that pupil, as well as constriction of the contralateral pupil. Shining a\\npenlight in the eye of a patient is a very artificial situation, as both eyes are normally exposed to the same light\\nsources. Testing this reflex can illustrate whether the optic nerve or the oculomotor nerve is damaged. If shining the\\nlight in one eye results in no changes in pupillary size but shining light in the opposite eye elicits a normal, bilateral\\nresponse, the damage is associated with the optic nerve on the nonresponsive side. If light in either eye elicits a\\nresponse in only one eye, the problem is with the oculomotor system.\\nIf light in the right eye only causes the left pupil to constrict, the direct reflex is lost and the consensual reflex is\\nintact, which means that the right oculomotor nerve (or Edinger–Westphal nucleus) is damaged. Damage to the right\\noculomotor connections will be evident when light is shined in the left eye. In that case, the direct reflex is intact but\\nthe consensual reflex is lost, meaning that the left pupil will constrict while the right does not.\\n16.3 • The Cranial Nerve Exam 643'),\n",

The cranial nerves connect the head and\\nneck directly to the brain, but the spinal cord receives sensory input and sends motor commands out to the body\\nthrough the spinal nerves. Whereas the brain develops into a complex series of nuclei and fiber tracts, the spinal\\ncord remains relatively simple in its configuration (Figure 16.12). From the initial neural tube early in embryonic\\ndevelopment, the spinal cord retains a tube-like structure with gray matter surrounding the small central canal and\\nwhite matter on the surface in three columns. The dorsal, or posterior, horns of the gray matter are mainly devoted\\nto sensory functions whereas the ventral, or anterior, and lateral horns are associated with motor functions. In the\\nwhite matter, the dorsal column relays sensory information to the brain, and the anterior column is almost\\nexclusively relaying motor commands to the ventral horn motor neurons. The lateral column, however, conveys both\\nsensory and motor information between the spinal cord and brain.\\nFIGURE 16.12 Locations of Spinal Fiber Tracts\\nSensory Modalities and Location\\nThe general senses are distributed throughout the body, relying on nervous tissue incorporated into various organs.\\nSomatic senses are incorporated mostly into the skin, muscles, or tendons, whereas the visceral senses come from\\nnervous tissue incorporated into the majority of organs such as the heart or stomach.

To test the sensory fields, a simple stimulus of the light touch of the soft end of\\na cotton-tipped applicator is applied at various locations on the skin. The spinal nerves, which contain sensory fibers\\nwith dendritic endings in the skin, connect with the skin in a topographically organized manner, illustrated as\\ndermatomes (Figure 16.13). For example, the fibers of eighth cervical nerve innervate the medial surface of the\\nforearm and extend out to the fingers. In addition to testing perception at different positions on the skin, it is\\nnecessary to test sensory perception within the dermatome from distal to proximal locations in the appendages, or\\nlateral to medial locations in the trunk.

The patient would be asked in what direction the\\nstimulus is moving. All of these tests are repeated in distal and proximal locations and for different dermatomes to\\nassess the spatial specificity of perception. The sense of position and motion, proprioception, is tested by moving\\nthe fingers or toes and asking the patient if they sense the movement. If the distal locations are not perceived, the\\ntest is repeated at increasingly proximal joints.\\nThe various stimuli used to test sensory input assess the function of the major ascending tracts of the spinal cord.\\nThe dorsal column pathway conveys fine touch, vibration, and proprioceptive information, whereas the\\nspinothalamic pathway primarily conveys pain and temperature. Testing these stimuli provides information about\\nwhether these two major ascending pathways are functioning properly. Within the spinal cord, the two systems are\\nsegregated. The dorsal column information ascends ipsilateral to the source of the stimulus and decussates in the\\nmedulla, whereas the spinothalamic pathway decussates at the level of entry and ascends contralaterally. The\\ndiffering sensory stimuli are segregated in the spinal cord so that the various subtests for these stimuli can\\ndistinguish which ascending pathway may be damaged in certain situations.\\nWhereas the basic sensory stimuli are assessed in the subtests directed at each submodality of somatosensation,\\ntesting the ability to discriminate sensations is important. Pairing the light touch and pain subtests together makes it\\npossible to compare the two submodalities at the same time, and therefore the two major ascending tracts at the\\nsame time. Mistaking painful stimuli for light touch, or vice versa, may point to errors in ascending projections, such\\nas in a hemisection of the spinal cord that might come from a motor vehicle accident.\\nAnother issue of sensory discrimination is not distinguishing between different submodalities, but rather location.\\nThe two-point discrimination subtest highlights the density of sensory endings, and therefore receptive fields in the\\nskin. The sensitivity to fine touch, which can give indications of the texture and detailed shape of objects, is highest\\nin the fingertips. To assess the limit of this sensitivity, two-point discrimination is measured by simultaneously\\ntouching the skin in two locations, such as could be accomplished with a pair of forceps. Specialized calipers for\\nprecisely measuring the distance between points are also available. The patient is asked to indicate whether one or\\ntwo stimuli are present while keeping their eyes closed. The examiner will switch between using the two points and\\na single point as the stimulus. Failure to recognize two points may be an indication of a dorsal column pathway\\ndeficit.\\nSimilar to two-point discrimination, but assessing laterality of perception, is double simultaneous stimulation. Two\\nstimuli, such as the cotton tips of two applicators, are touched to the same position on both sides of the body. If one\\nside is not perceived, this may indicate damage to the contralateral posterior parietal lobe. Because there is one of\\neach pathway on either side of the spinal cord, they are not likely to interact. If none of the other subtests suggest\\nparticular deficits with the pathways, the deficit is likely to be in the cortex where conscious perception is based.\\nThe mental status exam contains subtests that assess other functions that are primarily localized to the parietal\\ncortex, such as stereognosis and graphesthesia.\\nA final subtest of sensory perception that concentrates on the sense of proprioception is known as the Romberg\\ntest.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 662}, page_content='Muscle Strength and Voluntary Movement\\nThe skeletomotor system is largely based on the simple, two-cell projection from the precentral gyrus of the frontal\\nlobe to the skeletal muscles. The corticospinal tract represents the neurons that send output from the primary\\nmotor cortex. These fibers travel through the deep white matter of the cerebrum, then through the midbrain and\\npons, into the medulla where most of them decussate, and finally through the spinal cord white matter in the lateral\\n(crossed fibers) or anterior (uncrossed fibers) columns. These fibers synapse on motor neurons in the ventral horn.\\nThe ventral horn motor neurons then project to skeletal muscle and cause contraction. These two cells are termed\\nthe upper motor neuron (UMN) and the lower motor neuron (LMN). Voluntary movements require these two cells to\\nbe active.\\nThe motor exam tests the function of these neurons and the muscles they control. First, the muscles are inspected\\nand palpated for signs of structural irregularities. Movement disorders may be the result of changes to the muscle\\ntissue, such as scarring, and these possibilities need to be ruled out before testing function. Along with this\\ninspection, muscle tone is assessed by moving the muscles through a passive range of motion. The arm is moved at\\nthe elbow and wrist, and the leg is moved at the knee and ankle. Skeletal muscle should have a resting tension\\nrepresenting a slight contraction of the fibers. The lack of muscle tone, known as hypotonicity or flaccidity, may\\nindicate that the LMN is not conducting action potentials that will keep a basal level of acetylcholine in the\\nneuromuscular junction.\\nIf muscle tone is present, muscle strength is tested by having the patient contract muscles against resistance. The\\nexaminer will ask the patient to lift the arm, for example, while the examiner is pushing down on it. This is done for\\nboth limbs, including shrugging the shoulders. Lateral differences in strength—being able to push against resistance\\nwith the right arm but not the left—would indicate a deficit in one corticospinal tract versus the other. An overall loss\\nof strength, without laterality, could indicate a global problem with the motor system. Diseases that result in UMN\\nlesions include cerebral palsy or MS, or it may be the result of a stroke. A sign of UMN lesion is a negative result in\\nthe subtest for pronator drift. The patient is asked to extend both arms in front of the body with the palms facing\\nup. While keeping the eyes closed, if the patient unconsciously allows one or the other arm to slowly relax, toward\\nthe pronated position, this could indicate a failure of the motor system to maintain the supinated position.\\nReflexes\\nReflexes combine the spinal sensory and motor components with a sensory input that directly generates a motor\\nresponse. The reflexes that are tested in the neurological exam are classified into two groups. A deep tendon reflex\\nis commonly known as a stretch reflex, and is elicited by a strong tap to a tendon, such as in the knee-jerk reflex. A\\nsuperficial reflex is elicited through gentle stimulation of the skin and causes contraction of the associated\\nmuscles.\\nFor the arm, the common reflexes to test are of the biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, and flexors for the digits. For the\\nleg, the knee-jerk reflex of the quadriceps is common, as is the ankle reflex for the gastrocnemius and soleus. The\\ntendon at the insertion for each of these muscles is struck with a rubber mallet. The muscle is quickly stretched,\\nresulting in activation of the muscle spindle that sends a signal into the spinal cord through the dorsal root. The fiber\\nsynapses directly on the ventral horn motor neuron that activates the muscle, causing contraction. The reflexes are\\nphysiologically useful for stability. If a muscle is stretched, it reflexively contracts to return the muscle to\\ncompensate for the change in length. In the context of the neurological exam, reflexes indicate that the LMN is\\nfunctioning properly.\\nThe most common superficial reflex in the neurological exam is the plantar reflex that tests for the Babinski sign\\non the basis of the extension or flexion of the toes at the plantar surface of the foot. The plantar reflex is commonly\\ntested in newborn infants to establish the presence of neuromuscular function. To elicit this reflex, an examiner\\nbrushes a stimulus, usually the examiner’s fingertip, along the plantar surface of the infant’s foot. An infant would\\npresent a positive Babinski sign, meaning the foot dorsiflexes and the toes extend and splay out. As a person learns\\nto walk, the plantar reflex changes to cause curling of the toes and a moderate plantar flexion. If superficial\\nstimulation of the sole of the foot caused extension of the foot, keeping one’s balance would be harder. The\\ndescending input of the corticospinal tract modifies the response of the plantar reflex, meaning that a negative\\nBabinski sign is the expected response in testing the reflex. Other superficial reflexes are not commonly tested,\\nthough a series of abdominal reflexes can target function in the lower thoracic spinal segments.\\n16.4 • The Sensory and Motor Exams 647'),\n",

Testing reflexes of the\\ntrunk is not commonly performed in the neurological exam, but if findings suggest a problem with the thoracic\\nsegments of the spinal cord, a series of superficial reflexes of the abdomen can localize function to those segments.\\nIf contraction is not observed when the skin lateral to the umbilicus (belly button) is stimulated, what level of the\\nspinal cord may be damaged?\\nComparison of Upper and Lower Motor Neuron Damage\\nMany of the tests of motor function can indicate differences that will address whether damage to the motor system\\nis in the upper or lower motor neurons. Signs that suggest a UMN lesion include muscle weakness, strong deep\\ntendon reflexes, decreased control of movement or slowness, pronator drift, a positive Babinski sign, spasticity, and\\nthe clasp-knife response. Spasticity is an excess contraction in resistance to stretch. It can result in hyperflexia,\\nwhich is when joints are overly flexed. The clasp-knife response occurs when the patient initially resists movement,\\nbut then releases, and the joint will quickly flex like a pocket knife closing.\\nA lesion on the LMN would result in paralysis, or at least partial loss of voluntary muscle control, which is known as\\nparesis. The paralysis observed in LMN diseases is referred to as flaccid paralysis, referring to a complete or partial\\nloss of muscle tone, in contrast to the loss of control in UMN lesions in which tone is retained and spasticity is\\nexhibited. Other signs of an LMN lesion are fibrillation, fasciculation, and compromised or lost reflexes resulting\\nfrom the denervation of the muscle fibers.\\nDisorders of the...\\nSpinal Cord\\nIn certain situations, such as a motorcycle accident, only half of the spinal cord may be damaged in what is\\nknown as a hemisection. Forceful trauma to the trunk may cause ribs or vertebrae to fracture, and debris can\\ncrush or section through part of the spinal cord. The full section of a spinal cord would result in paraplegia, or\\nloss of voluntary motor control of the lower body, as well as loss of sensations from that point down. A\\nhemisection, however, will leave spinal cord tracts intact on one side. The resulting condition would be\\nhemiplegia on the side of the trauma—one leg would be paralyzed. The sensory results are more complicated.\\nThe ascending tracts in the spinal cord are segregated between the dorsal column and spinothalamic pathways.\\nThis means that the sensory deficits will be based on the particular sensory information each pathway conveys.\\nSensory discrimination between touch and painful stimuli will illustrate the difference in how these pathways\\ndivide these functions.\\nOn the paralyzed leg, a patient will acknowledge painful stimuli, but not fine touch or proprioceptive sensations.\\nOn the functional leg, the opposite is true. The reason for this is that the dorsal column pathway ascends\\nipsilateral to the sensation, so it would be damaged the same way as the lateral corticospinal tract. The\\nspinothalamic pathway decussates immediately upon entering the spinal cord and ascends contralateral to the\\nsource; it would therefore bypass the hemisection.\\nThe motor system can indicate the loss of input to the ventral horn in the lumbar enlargement where motor\\nneurons to the leg are found, but motor function in the trunk is less clear. The left and right anterior corticospinal\\ntracts are directly adjacent to each other. The likelihood of trauma to the spinal cord resulting in a hemisection\\nthat affects one anterior column, but not the other, is very unlikely. Either the axial musculature will not be\\naffected at all, or there will be bilateral losses in the trunk.\\nSensory discrimination can pinpoint the level of damage in the spinal cord. Below the hemisection, pain stimuli\\nwill be perceived in the damaged side, but not fine touch. The opposite is true on the other side. The pain fibers\\non the side with motor function cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral lateral\\ncolumn as far as the hemisection. The dorsal column will be intact ipsilateral to the source on the intact side and\\nreach the brain for conscious perception. The trauma would be at the level just before sensory discrimination\\nreturns to normal, helping to pinpoint the trauma.

There is an obvious connection to motor function based on the\\nclinical implications of cerebellar damage. There is also strong evidence of the cerebellar role in procedural memory.\\nThe two are not incompatible; in fact, procedural memory is motor memory, such as learning to ride a bicycle.\\nSignificant work has been performed to describe the connections within the cerebellum that result in learning. A\\nmodel for this learning is classical conditioning, as shown by the famous dogs from the physiologist Ivan Pavlov’s\\nwork. This classical conditioning, which can be related to motor learning, fits with the neural connections of the\\ncerebellum. The cerebellum is 10 percent of the mass of the brain and has varied functions that all point to a role in\\nthe motor system.\\nLocation and Connections of the Cerebellum\\nThe cerebellum is located in apposition to the dorsal surface of the brain stem, centered on the pons. The name of\\nthe pons is derived from its connection to the cerebellum. The word means “bridge” and refers to the thick bundle of\\nmyelinated axons that form a bulge on its ventral surface. Those fibers are axons that project from the gray matter of\\nthe pons into the contralateral cerebellar cortex. These fibers make up the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) and\\nare the major physical connection of the cerebellum to the brain stem (Figure 16.14). Two other white matter\\nbundles connect the cerebellum to the other regions of the brain stem. The superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) is\\nthe connection of the cerebellum to the midbrain and forebrain. The inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) is the\\nconnection to the medulla.\\nFIGURE 16.14 Cerebellar Peduncles The connections to the cerebellum are the three cerebellar peduncles, which are close to each\\nother. The ICP arises from the medulla—specifically from the inferior olive, which is visible as a bulge on the ventral surface of the brain\\nstem. The MCP is the ventral surface of the pons. The SCP projects into the midbrain.\\nThese connections can also be broadly described by their functions. The ICP conveys sensory input to the\\nimaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scanning, could localize the injury as well, nothing more\\ncomplicated than a cotton-tipped applicator can localize the damage. That may be all that is available on the\\nscene when moving the victim requires crucial decisions be made.\\n16.5 • The Coordination and Gait Exams 649'),\n",

The MCP is part of\\nthe cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway that connects the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum and preferentially\\ntargets the lateral regions of the cerebellum. It includes a copy of the motor commands sent from the precentral\\ngyrus through the corticospinal tract, arising from collateral branches that synapse in the gray matter of the pons,\\nalong with input from other regions such as the visual cortex. The SCP is the major output of the cerebellum, divided\\nbetween the red nucleus in the midbrain and the thalamus, which will return cerebellar processing to the motor\\ncortex. These connections describe a circuit that compares motor commands and sensory feedback to generate a\\nnew output. These comparisons make it possible to coordinate movements. If the cerebral cortex sends a motor\\ncommand to initiate walking, that command is copied by the pons and sent into the cerebellum through the MCP.\\nSensory feedback in the form of proprioception from the spinal cord, as well as vestibular sensations from the inner\\near, enters through the ICP. If you take a step and begin to slip on the floor because it is wet, the output from the\\ncerebellum—through the SCP—can correct for that and keep you balanced and moving. The red nucleus sends new\\nmotor commands to the spinal cord through the rubrospinal tract.\\nThe cerebellum is divided into regions that are based on the particular functions and connections involved. The\\nmidline regions of the cerebellum, the vermis and flocculonodular lobe, are involved in comparing visual\\ninformation, equilibrium, and proprioceptive feedback to maintain balance and coordinate movements such as\\nwalking, or gait, through the descending output of the red nucleus (Figure 16.15). The lateral hemispheres are\\nprimarily concerned with planning motor functions through frontal lobe inputs that are returned through the\\nthalamic projections back to the premotor and motor cortices. Processing in the midline regions targets movements\\nof the axial musculature, whereas the lateral regions target movements of the appendicular musculature. The\\nvermis is referred to as the spinocerebellum because it primarily receives input from the dorsal columns and\\nspinocerebellar pathways. The flocculonodular lobe is referred to as the vestibulocerebellum because of the\\nvestibular projection into that region. Finally, the lateral cerebellum is referred to as the cerebrocerebellum,\\nreflecting the significant input from the cerebral cortex through the cortico-ponto-cerebellar pathway.\\nFIGURE 16.15 Major Regions of the Cerebellum The cerebellum can be divided into two basic regions: the midline and the\\nhemispheres. The midline is composed of the vermis and the flocculonodular lobe, and the hemispheres are the lateral regions.\\nCoordination and Alternating Movement\\nTesting for cerebellar function is the basis of the coordination exam. The subtests target appendicular musculature,\\ncontrolling the limbs, and axial musculature for posture and gait. The assessment of cerebellar function will depend\\non the normal functioning of other systems addressed in previous sections of the neurological exam. Motor control\\nfrom the cerebrum, as well as sensory input from somatic, visual, and vestibular senses, are important to cerebellar\\nfunction.\\nThe subtests that address appendicular musculature, and therefore the lateral regions of the cerebellum, begin with\\na check for tremor. The patient extends their arms in front of them and holds the position. The examiner watches for\\nthe presence of tremors that would not be present if the muscles are relaxed. By pushing down on the arms in this\\nposition, the examiner can check for the rebound response, which is when the arms are automatically brought back\\n650 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The extension of the arms is an ongoing motor process, and the tap or push on the arms\\npresents a change in the proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum compares the cerebral motor command with the\\nproprioceptive feedback and adjusts the descending input to correct. The red nucleus would send an additional\\nsignal to the LMN for the arm to increase contraction momentarily to overcome the change and regain the original\\nposition.\\nThe check reflex depends on cerebellar input to keep increased contraction from continuing after the removal of\\nresistance. The patient flexes the elbow against resistance from the examiner to extend the elbow. When the\\nexaminer releases the arm, the patient should be able to stop the increased contraction and keep the arm from\\nmoving. A similar response would be seen if you try to pick up a coffee mug that you believe to be full but turns out\\nto be empty. Without checking the contraction, the mug would be thrown from the overexertion of the muscles\\nexpecting to lift a heavier object.\\nSeveral subtests of the cerebellum assess the ability to alternate movements, or switch between muscle groups that\\nmay be antagonistic to each other. In the finger-to-nose test, the patient touches their finger to the examiner’s\\nfinger and then to their nose, and then back to the examiner’s finger, and back to the nose. The examiner moves the\\ntarget finger to assess a range of movements. A similar test for the lower extremities has the patient touch their toe\\nto a moving target, such as the examiner’s finger. Both of these tests involve flexion and extension around a\\njoint—the elbow or the knee and the shoulder or hip—as well as movements of the wrist and ankle. The patient must\\nswitch between the opposing muscles, like the biceps and triceps brachii, to move their finger from the target to\\ntheir nose. Coordinating these movements involves the motor cortex communicating with the cerebellum through\\nthe pons and feedback through the thalamus to plan the movements. Visual cortex information is also part of the\\nprocessing that occurs in the cerebrocerebellum while it is involved in guiding movements of the finger or toe.\\nRapid, alternating movements are tested for the upper and lower extremities. The patient is asked to touch each\\nfinger to their thumb, or to pat the palm of one hand on the back of the other, and then flip that hand over and\\nalternate back-and-forth. To test similar function in the lower extremities, the patient touches their heel to their shin\\nnear the knee and slides it down toward the ankle, and then back again, repetitively. Rapid, alternating movements\\nare part of speech as well. A patient is asked to repeat the nonsense consonants “lah-kah-pah” to alternate\\nmovements of the tongue, lips, and palate. All of these rapid alternations require planning from the\\ncerebrocerebellum to coordinate movement commands that control the coordination.\\nPosture and Gait\\nGait can either be considered a separate part of the neurological exam or a subtest of the coordination exam that\\naddresses walking and balance. Testing posture and gait addresses functions of the spinocerebellum and the\\nvestibulocerebellum because both are part of these activities. A subtest called station begins with the patient\\nstanding in a normal position to check for the placement of the feet and balance. The patient is asked to hop on one\\nfoot to assess the ability to maintain balance and posture during movement. Though the station subtest appears to\\nbe similar to the Romberg test, the difference is that the patient’s eyes are open during station. The Romberg test\\nhas the patient stand still with the eyes closed. Any changes in posture would be the result of proprioceptive\\ndeficits, and the patient is able to recover when they open their eyes.\\nSubtests of walking begin with having the patient walk normally for a distance away from the examiner, and then\\nturn and return to the starting position. The examiner watches for abnormal placement of the feet and the\\nmovement of the arms relative to the movement. The patient is then asked to walk with a few different variations.\\nTandem gait is when the patient places the heel of one foot against the toe of the other foot and walks in a straight\\nline in that manner. Walking only on the heels or only on the toes will test additional aspects of balance.\\nAtaxia\\nA movement disorder of the cerebellum is referred to as ataxia. It presents as a loss of coordination in voluntary\\nmovements. Ataxia can also refer to sensory deficits that cause balance problems, primarily in proprioception and\\nequilibrium. When the problem is observed in movement, it is ascribed to cerebellar damage. Sensory and vestibular\\nataxia would likely also present with problems in gait and station.\\nAtaxia is often the result of exposure to exogenous substances, focal lesions, or a genetic disorder.

To test the ability of a subject to maintain\\nbalance, asking them to stand or hop on one foot can be more demanding. The examiner may also push the subject\\nto see if they can maintain balance. An abnormal finding in the test of station is if the feet are placed far apart. Why\\nwould a wide stance suggest problems with cerebellar function?\\nEveryday Connection\\nThe Field Sobriety Test\\nThe neurological exam has been described as a clinical tool throughout this chapter. It is also useful in other\\nways. A variation of the coordination exam is the Field Sobriety Test (FST) used to assess whether drivers are\\nunder the influence of alcohol. The cerebellum is crucial for coordinated movements such as keeping balance\\nwhile walking, or moving appendicular musculature on the basis of proprioceptive feedback. The cerebellum is\\nalso very sensitive to ethanol, the particular type of alcohol found in beer, wine, and liquor.\\nWalking in a straight line involves comparing the motor command from the primary motor cortex to the\\nproprioceptive and vestibular sensory feedback, as well as following the visual guide of the white line on the side\\nof the road. When the cerebellum is compromised by alcohol, the cerebellum cannot coordinate these\\nmovements effectively, and maintaining balance becomes difficult.\\nAnother common aspect of the FST is to have the driver extend their arms out wide and touch their fingertip to\\ntheir nose, usually with their eyes closed. The point of this is to remove the visual feedback for the movement\\nand force the driver to rely just on proprioceptive information about the movement and position of their fingertip\\nrelative to their nose. With eyes open, the corrections to the movement of the arm might be so small as to be\\nhard to see, but proprioceptive feedback is not as immediate and broader movements of the arm will probably\\nbe needed, particularly if the cerebellum is affected by alcohol.\\nReciting the alphabet backwards is not always a component of the FST, but its relationship to neurological\\nfunction is interesting. There is a cognitive aspect to remembering how the alphabet goes and how to recite it\\nbackwards. That is actually a variation of the mental status subtest of repeating the months backwards.\\nHowever, the cerebellum is important because speech production is a coordinated activity. The speech rapid\\nalternating movement subtest is specifically using the consonant changes of “lah-kah-pah” to assess\\ncoordinated movements of the lips, tongue, pharynx, and palate. But the entire alphabet, especially in the\\nnonrehearsed backwards order, pushes this type of coordinated movement quite far. It is related to the reason\\nthat speech becomes slurred when a person is intoxicated.\\n652 16 • The Neurological Exam\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

It is divided into five major sections that each\\ndeal with a specific region of the CNS. The mental\\nstatus exam is concerned with the cerebrum and\\nassesses higher functions such as memory, language,\\nand emotion. The cranial nerve exam tests the\\nfunctions of all of the cranial nerves and, therefore,\\ntheir connections to the CNS through the forebrain and\\nbrain stem. The sensory and motor exams assess those\\nfunctions as they relate to the spinal cord, as well as\\nthe combination of the functions in spinal reflexes. The\\ncoordination exam targets cerebellar function in\\ncoordinated movements, including those functions\\nassociated with gait.\\nDamage to and disease of the nervous system lead to\\nloss of function. The location of the injury will\\ncorrespond to the functional loss, as suggested by the\\nprinciple of localization of function. The neurological\\nexam provides the opportunity for a clinician to\\ndetermine where damage has occurred on the basis of\\nthe function that is lost. Damage from acute injuries\\nsuch as strokes may result in specific functions being\\nlost, whereas broader effects in infection or\\ndevelopmental disorders may result in general losses\\nacross an entire section of the neurological exam.\\n16.2 The Mental Status Exam\\nThe cerebrum, particularly the cerebral cortex, is the\\nlocation of important cognitive functions that are the\\nfocus of the mental status exam. The regionalization of\\nthe cortex, initially described on the basis of\\nanatomical evidence of cytoarchitecture, reveals the\\ndistribution of functionally distinct areas. Cortical\\nregions can be described as primary sensory or motor\\nareas, association areas, or multimodal integration\\nareas. The functions attributed to these regions include\\nattention, memory, language, speech, sensation,\\njudgment, and abstract reasoning.\\nThe mental status exam addresses these cognitive\\nabilities through a series of subtests designed to elicit\\nparticular behaviors ascribed to these functions. The\\nloss of neurological function can illustrate the location\\nof damage to the cerebrum. Memory functions are\\nattributed to the temporal lobe, particularly the medial\\ntemporal lobe structures known as the hippocampus\\nand amygdala, along with the adjacent cortex.\\nEvidence of the importance of these structures comes\\nfrom the side effects of a bilateral temporal lobectomy\\nthat were studied in detail in patient HM.\\nLosses of language and speech functions, known as\\naphasias, are associated with damage to the important\\nintegration areas in the left hemisphere known as\\nBroca’s or Wernicke’s areas, as well as the connections\\nin the white matter between them. Different types of\\naphasia are named for the particular structures that\\nare damaged. Assessment of the functions of the\\nsensorium includes praxis and gnosis. The subtests\\nrelated to these functions depend on multimodal\\nintegration, as well as language-dependent processing.\\nThe prefrontal cortex contains structures important for\\nplanning, judgment, reasoning, and working memory.\\nDamage to these areas can result in changes to\\npersonality, mood, and behavior. The famous case of\\nPhineas Gage suggests a role for this cortex in\\npersonality, as does the outdated practice of prefrontal\\nlobectomy.\\n16.3 The Cranial Nerve Exam\\nThe cranial nerves can be separated into four major\\ngroups associated with the subtests of the cranial\\nnerve exam. First are the sensory nerves, then the\\nnerves that control eye movement, the nerves of the\\noral cavity and superior pharynx, and the nerve that\\ncontrols movements of the neck.\\nThe olfactory, optic, and vestibulocochlear nerves are\\nstrictly sensory nerves for smell, sight, and balance\\nand hearing, whereas the trigeminal, facial, and\\nglossopharyngeal nerves carry somatosensation of the\\n16 • Chapter Review 655'),\n",

General senses can be\\ntested through sensory discrimination of touch versus\\npainful stimuli.\\nThe oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves\\ncontrol the extraocular muscles and are connected by\\nthe medial longitudinal fasciculus to coordinate gaze.\\nTesting conjugate gaze is as simple as having the\\npatient follow a visual target, like a pen tip, through the\\nvisual field ending with an approach toward the face to\\ntest convergence and accommodation. Along with the\\nvestibular functions of the eighth nerve, the vestibulo-\\nocular reflex stabilizes gaze during head movements by\\ncoordinating equilibrium sensations with the eye\\nmovement systems.\\nThe trigeminal nerve controls the muscles of chewing,\\nwhich are tested for stretch reflexes. Motor functions of\\nthe facial nerve are usually obvious if facial expressions\\nare compromised, but can be tested by having the\\npatient raise their eyebrows, smile, and frown.\\nMovements of the tongue, soft palate, or superior\\npharynx can be observed directly while the patient\\nswallows, while the gag reflex is elicited, or while the\\npatient says repetitive consonant sounds. The motor\\ncontrol of the gag reflex is largely controlled by fibers in\\nthe vagus nerve and constitutes a test of that nerve\\nbecause the parasympathetic functions of that nerve\\nare involved in visceral regulation, such as regulating\\nthe heartbeat and digestion.\\nMovement of the head and neck using the\\nsternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles is\\ncontrolled by the accessory nerve. Flexing of the neck\\nand strength testing of those muscles reviews the\\nfunction of that nerve.\\n16.4 The Sensory and Motor Exams\\nThe sensory and motor exams assess function related\\nto the spinal cord and the nerves connected to it.\\nSensory functions are associated with the dorsal\\nregions of the spinal cord, whereas motor function is\\nassociated with the ventral side. Localizing damage to\\nthe spinal cord is related to assessments of the\\nperipheral projections mapped to dermatomes.\\nSensory tests address the various submodalities of the\\nsomatic senses: touch, temperature, vibration, pain,\\nand proprioception. Results of the subtests can point to\\ntrauma in the spinal cord gray matter, white matter, or\\neven in connections to the cerebral cortex.\\nMotor tests focus on the function of the muscles and\\nthe connections of the descending motor pathway.\\nMuscle tone and strength are tested for upper and\\nlower extremities. Input to the muscles comes from\\nthe descending cortical input of upper motor neurons\\nand the direct innervation of lower motor neurons.\\nReflexes can either be based on deep stimulation of\\ntendons or superficial stimulation of the skin. The\\npresence of reflexive contractions helps to differentiate\\nmotor disorders between the upper and lower motor\\nneurons. The specific signs associated with motor\\ndisorders can establish the difference further, based on\\nthe type of paralysis, the state of muscle tone, and\\nspecific indicators such as pronator drift or the\\nBabinski sign.\\n16.5 The Coordination and Gait Exams\\nThe cerebellum is an important part of motor function\\nin the nervous system. It apparently plays a role in\\nprocedural learning, which would include motor skills\\nsuch as riding a bike or throwing a football. The basis\\nfor these roles is likely to be tied into the role the\\ncerebellum plays as a comparator for voluntary\\nmovement.\\nThe motor commands from the cerebral hemispheres\\ntravel along the corticospinal pathway, which passes\\nthrough the pons. Collateral branches of these fibers\\nsynapse on neurons in the pons, which then project\\ninto the cerebellar cortex through the middle cerebellar\\npeduncles. Ascending sensory feedback, entering\\nthrough the inferior cerebellar peduncles, provides\\ninformation about motor performance. The cerebellar\\ncortex compares the command to the actual\\nperformance and can adjust the descending input to\\ncompensate for any mismatch. The output from deep\\ncerebellar nuclei projects through the superior\\ncerebellar peduncles to initiate descending signals\\nfrom the red nucleus to the spinal cord.\\nThe primary role of the cerebellum in relation to the\\nspinal cord is through the spinocerebellum; it controls\\nposture and gait with significant input from the\\nvestibular system. Deficits in cerebellar function result\\nin ataxias, or a specific kind of movement disorder. The\\nroot cause of the ataxia may be the sensory\\ninput—either the proprioceptive input from the spinal\\ncord or the equilibrium input from the vestibular\\nsystem, or direct damage to the cerebellum by stroke,\\ntrauma, hereditary factors, or toxins.\\n656 16 • Chapter Review\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Neurotransmitters act locally and rapidly. When an electrical signal in the form of an\\naction potential arrives at the synaptic terminal, they diffuse across the synaptic cleft (the gap between a sending\\nneuron and a receiving neuron or muscle cell). Once the neurotransmitters interact (bind) with receptors on the\\nreceiving (post-synaptic) cell, the receptor stimulation is transduced into a response such as continued electrical\\nsignaling or modification of cellular response. The target cell responds within milliseconds of receiving the chemical\\n“message”; this response then ceases very quickly once the neural signaling ends. In this way, neural\\ncommunication enables body functions that involve quick, brief actions, such as movement, sensation, and\\ncognition.In contrast, the endocrine system uses just one method of communication: chemical signaling. These\\nsignals are sent by the endocrine organs, which secrete chemicals—the hormone—into the extracellular fluid.\\nHormones are transported primarily via the bloodstream throughout the body, where they bind to receptors on\\ntarget cells, inducing a characteristic response. As a result, endocrine signaling requires more time than neural\\nsignaling to prompt a response in target cells, though the precise amount of time varies with different hormones. For\\nexample, the hormones released when you are confronted with a dangerous or frightening situation, called the fight-\\nor-flight response, occur by the release of adrenal hormones—epinephrine and norepinephrine—within seconds. In\\ncontrast, it may take up to 48 hours for target cells to respond to certain reproductive hormones.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/hormonebind) to watch an animation of the events that occur when a hormone\\nbinds to a cell membrane receptor. What is the secondary messenger made by adenylyl cyclase during the activation\\nof liver cells by epinephrine?\\nIn addition, endocrine signaling is typically less specific than neural signaling. The same hormone may play a role in\\na variety of different physiological processes depending on the target cells involved. For example, the hormone\\noxytocin promotes uterine contractions in people in labor. It is also important in breastfeeding, and may be involved\\nin the sexual response and in feelings of emotional attachment in humans.\\nIn general, the nervous system involves quick responses to rapid changes in the external environment, and the\\nendocrine system is usually slower acting—taking care of the internal environment of the body, maintaining\\nhomeostasis, and controlling reproduction (Table 17.1). So how does the fight-or-flight response that was\\nmentioned earlier happen so quickly if hormones are usually slower acting? It is because the two systems are\\nconnected. It is the fast action of the nervous system in response to the danger in the environment that stimulates\\nthe adrenal glands to secrete their hormones. As a result, the nervous system can cause rapid endocrine responses\\nto keep up with sudden changes in both the external and internal environments when necessary.\\nEndocrine and Nervous Systems\\nEndocrine system Nervous system\\nSignaling mechanism(s) Chemical Chemical/electrical\\nPrimary chemical signal Hormones Neurotransmitters\\nDistance traveled Long or short Always short\\nTABLE 17.1\\n662 17 • The Endocrine System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The endocrine gland is the major player in this system. The primary function of these ductless glands is to\\nsecrete their hormones directly into the surrounding fluid. The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport\\nthe hormones throughout the body. The endocrine system includes the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and\\npineal glands (Figure 17.2). Some of these glands have both endocrine and non-endocrine functions. For example,\\nthe pancreas contains cells that function in digestion as well as cells that secrete the hormones insulin and\\nglucagon, which regulate blood glucose levels. The hypothalamus, thymus, heart, kidneys, stomach, small intestine,\\nliver, skin, ovaries, and testes are other organs that contain cells with endocrine function. Moreover, adipose tissue\\nhas long been known to produce hormones, and recent research has revealed that even bone tissue has endocrine\\nfunctions.\\nFIGURE 17.2 Endocrine System Endocrine glands and cells are located throughout the body and play an important role in\\nhomeostasis.\\nThe ductless endocrine glands are not to be confused with the body’s exocrine system, whose glands release their\\nsecretions through ducts. Examples of exocrine glands include the sebaceous and sweat glands of the skin. As just\\nnoted, the pancreas also has an exocrine function: most of its cells secrete pancreatic juice through the pancreatic\\n17.1 • An Overview of the Endocrine System 663'),\n",

In contrast, autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell. An\\nautocrine (auto- = “self”) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it. Interleukin-1, or\\nIL-1, is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response. The cells that secrete IL-1 have\\nreceptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules, resulting in autocrine signaling.\\nLocal intercellular communication is the province of the paracrine, also called a paracrine factor, which is a\\nchemical that induces a response in neighboring cells. Although paracrines may enter the bloodstream, their\\nconcentration is generally too low to elicit a response from distant tissues. A familiar example to those with asthma\\nis histamine, a paracrine that is released by immune cells in the bronchial tree. Histamine causes the smooth\\nmuscle cells of the bronchi to constrict, narrowing the airways. Another example is the neurotransmitters of the\\nnervous system, which act only locally within the synaptic cleft.\\nCAREER C ONNE CTION\\nEndocrinologist\\nEndocrinology is a specialty in the field of medicine that focuses on the treatment of endocrine system disorders.\\nEndocrinologists—medical doctors who specialize in this field—are experts in treating diseases associated with\\nhormonal systems, ranging from thyroid disease to diabetes mellitus. Endocrine surgeons treat endocrine disease\\nthrough the removal, or resection, of the affected endocrine gland.\\nPatients who are referred to endocrinologists may have signs and symptoms or blood test results that suggest\\nexcessive or impaired functioning of an endocrine gland or endocrine cells. The endocrinologist may order additional\\nblood tests to determine whether the patient’s hormonal levels are abnormal, or they may stimulate or suppress the\\nfunction of the suspect endocrine gland and then have blood taken for analysis. Treatment varies according to the\\ndiagnosis. Some endocrine disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, may respond to lifestyle changes such as modest\\nweight loss, adoption of a healthy diet, and regular physical activity. Other disorders may require medication, such\\nas hormone replacement, and routine monitoring by the endocrinologist. These include disorders of the pituitary\\ngland that can affect growth and disorders of the thyroid gland that can result in a variety of metabolic problems.\\nSome patients experience health problems as a result of the normal decline in hormones that can accompany aging.\\nThese patients can consult with an endocrinologist to weigh the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy\\nintended to boost their natural levels of reproductive hormones.\\nIn addition to treating patients, endocrinologists may be involved in research to improve the understanding of\\nendocrine system disorders and develop new treatments for these diseases.\\n17.2 Hormones\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the three major classes of hormones on the basis of chemical structure\\n• Compare and contrast intracellular and cell membrane hormone receptors\\n• Describe signaling pathways that involve cAMP and IP3\\n• Identify several factors that influence a target cell’s response\\n• Discuss the role of feedback loops and humoral, hormonal, and neural stimuli in hormone control\\nAlthough a given hormone may travel throughout the body in the bloodstream, it will affect the activity only of its\\ntarget cells; that is, cells with receptors for that particular hormone.

Peptide hormones consist of short chains of amino acids,\\nwhereas protein hormones are longer polypeptides. Both types are synthesized like other body proteins: DNA is\\ntranscribed into mRNA, which is translated into an amino acid chain.\\nExamples of peptide hormones include antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a pituitary hormone important in fluid balance,\\nand atrial-natriuretic peptide, which is produced by the heart and helps to decrease blood pressure. Some examples\\nof protein hormones include growth hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland, and follicle-stimulating\\nhormone (FSH), which has an attached carbohydrate group and is thus classified as a glycoprotein. FSH helps\\nstimulate the maturation of eggs in the ovaries and sperm in the testes.\\nSteroid Hormones\\nThe primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids. Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol. For\\nexample, the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens—which are produced by the gonads (testes\\nand ovaries)—are steroid hormones. The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone, which is involved\\nin osmoregulation, and cortisol, which plays a role in metabolism.\\nLike cholesterol, steroid hormones are not soluble in water (they are hydrophobic). Because blood is water-based,\\nlipid-derived hormones must travel to their target cell bound to a transport protein. This more complex structure\\nextends the half-life of steroid hormones much longer than that of hormones derived from amino acids. A hormone’s\\nhalf-life is the time required for half the concentration of the hormone to be degraded. For example, the lipid-\\nderived hormone cortisol has a half-life of approximately 60 to 90 minutes. In contrast, the amino acid–derived\\nhormone epinephrine has a half-life of approximately one minute.\\nPathways of Hormone Action\\nThe message a hormone sends is received by a hormone receptor, a protein located either inside the cell or within\\nthe cell membrane. The receptor will process the message by initiating other signaling events or cellular\\nmechanisms that result in the target cell’s response. Hormone receptors recognize molecules with specific shapes\\nand side groups, and respond only to those hormones that are recognized. The same type of receptor may be\\nlocated on cells in different body tissues, and trigger somewhat different responses. Thus, the response triggered by\\na hormone depends not only on the hormone, but also on the target cell.\\nOnce the target cell receives the hormone signal, it can respond in a variety of ways. The response may include the\\nstimulation of protein synthesis, activation or deactivation of enzymes, alteration in the permeability of the cell\\nmembrane, altered rates of mitosis and cell growth, and stimulation of the secretion of products. Moreover, a single\\nhormone may be capable of inducing different responses in a given cell.\\nPathways Involving Intracellular Hormone Receptors\\nIntracellular hormone receptors are located inside the cell. Hormones that bind to this type of receptor must be able\\nto cross the cell membrane. Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and therefore can readily diffuse\\nthrough the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane to reach the intracellular receptor (Figure 17.4). Thyroid hormones,\\ncross the cell membrane by a specific carrier-mediated mechanism that is energy and Na+ dependent.\\nThe location of steroid and thyroid hormone binding differs slightly: a steroid hormone may bind to its receptor\\nwithin the cytosol or within the nucleus. In either case, this binding generates a hormone-receptor complex that\\nmoves toward the chromatin in the cell nucleus and binds to a particular segment of the cell’s DNA. In contrast,\\nthyroid hormones bind to receptors already bound to DNA. For both steroid and thyroid hormones, binding of the\\nhormone-receptor complex with DNA triggers transcription of a target gene to mRNA, which moves to the cytosol\\nand directs protein synthesis by ribosomes.\\n668 17 • The Endocrine System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The hormone binds to its receptor in the cytosol, forming a receptor–hormone\\ncomplex. The receptor–hormone complex then enters the nucleus and binds to the target gene on the DNA. Transcription of the gene\\ncreates a messenger RNA that is translated into the desired protein within the cytoplasm.\\nPathways Involving Cell Membrane Hormone Receptors\\nHydrophilic, or water-soluble, hormones are unable to diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and\\nmust therefore pass on their message to a receptor located at the surface of the cell. Except for thyroid hormones,\\nwhich are lipid-soluble, all amino acid–derived hormones bind to cell membrane receptors that are located, at least\\nin part, on the extracellular surface of the cell membrane. Therefore, they do not directly affect the transcription of\\ntarget genes, but instead initiate a signaling cascade that is carried out by a molecule called a second messenger.\\nIn this case, the hormone is called a first messenger.\\nThe second messenger used by most hormones is cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In the cAMP second\\nmessenger system, a water-soluble hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane (Step 1 in Figure 17.5). This\\nreceptor is associated with an intracellular component called a G protein, and binding of the hormone activates the\\nG-protein component (Step 2). The activated G protein in turn activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, also\\nknown as adenylate cyclase (Step 3), which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cAMP (Step 4). As the second\\nmessenger, cAMP activates a type of enzyme called a protein kinase that is present in the cytosol (Step 5).\\nActivated protein kinases initiate a phosphorylation cascade, in which multiple protein kinases phosphorylate (add\\na phosphate group to) numerous and various cellular proteins, including other enzymes (Step 6).\\n17.2 • Hormones 669'),\n",

These\\nhormones must bind to a surface cell-membrane receptor. The receptor then initiates a cell-signaling pathway within the cell involving G\\nproteins, adenylyl cyclase, the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), and protein kinases. In the final step, these protein kinases\\nphosphorylate proteins in the cytoplasm. This activates proteins in the cell that carry out the changes specified by the hormone.\\nThe phosphorylation of cellular proteins can trigger a wide variety of effects, from nutrient metabolism to the\\nsynthesis of different hormones and other products. The effects vary according to the type of target cell, the G\\nproteins and kinases involved, and the phosphorylation of proteins. Examples of hormones that use cAMP as a\\nsecond messenger include calcitonin, which is important for bone construction and regulating blood calcium levels;\\nglucagon, which plays a role in blood glucose levels; and thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the release of\\nT3 and T4 from the thyroid gland.\\nOverall, the phosphorylation cascade significantly increases the efficiency, speed, and specificity of the hormonal\\nresponse, as thousands of signaling events can be initiated simultaneously in response to a very low concentration\\nof hormone in the bloodstream. However, the duration of the hormone signal is short, as cAMP is quickly deactivated\\nby the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which is located in the cytosol. The action of PDE helps to ensure that a\\ntarget cell’s response ceases quickly unless new hormones arrive at the cell membrane.\\nImportantly, there are also G proteins that decrease the levels of cAMP in the cell in response to hormone binding.\\nFor example, when growth hormone–inhibiting hormone (GHIH), also known as somatostatin, binds to its receptors\\nin the pituitary gland, the level of cAMP decreases, thereby inhibiting the secretion of human growth hormone.\\nNot all water-soluble hormones initiate the cAMP second messenger system. One common alternative system uses\\ncalcium ions as a second messenger. In this system, G proteins activate the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC), which\\nfunctions similarly to adenylyl cyclase. Once activated, PLC cleaves a membrane-bound phospholipid into two\\nmolecules: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Like cAMP, DAG activates protein kinases that\\ninitiate a phosphorylation cascade. At the same time, IP3 causes calcium ions to be released from storage sites\\nwithin the cytosol, such as from within the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions then act as second\\nmessengers in two ways: they can influence enzymatic and other cellular activities directly, or they can bind to\\ncalcium-binding proteins, the most common of which is calmodulin. Upon binding calcium, calmodulin is able to\\nmodulate protein kinase within the cell. Examples of hormones that use calcium ions as a second messenger\\nsystem include angiotensin II, which helps regulate blood pressure through vasoconstriction, and growth\\nhormone–releasing hormone (GHRH), which causes the pituitary gland to release growth hormones.\\n670 17 • The Endocrine System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 686}, page_content='Factors Affecting Target Cell Response\\nYou will recall that target cells must have receptors specific to a given hormone if that hormone is to trigger a\\nresponse. But several other factors influence the target cell response. For example, the presence of a significant\\nlevel of a hormone circulating in the bloodstream can cause its target cells to decrease their number of receptors for\\nthat hormone. This process is called downregulation, and it allows cells to become less reactive to the excessive\\nhormone levels. When the level of a hormone is chronically reduced, target cells engage in upregulation to increase\\ntheir number of receptors. This process allows cells to be more sensitive to the hormone that is present. Cells can\\nalso alter the sensitivity of the receptors themselves to various hormones.\\nTwo or more hormones can interact to affect the response of cells in a variety of ways. The three most common\\ntypes of interaction are as follows:\\n• The permissive effect, in which the presence of one hormone enables another hormone to act. For example,\\nthyroid hormones have complex permissive relationships with certain reproductive hormones. A dietary\\ndeficiency of iodine, a component of thyroid hormones, can therefore affect reproductive system development\\nand functioning.\\n• The synergistic effect, in which two hormones with similar effects produce an amplified response. In some\\ncases, two hormones are required for an adequate response. For example, two different reproductive\\nhormones—FSH from the pituitary gland and estrogens from the ovaries—are required for the maturation of\\nfemale ova (egg cells).\\n• The antagonistic effect, in which two hormones have opposing effects. A familiar example is the effect of two\\npancreatic hormones, insulin and glucagon. Insulin increases the liver’s storage of glucose as glycogen,\\ndecreasing blood glucose, whereas glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores, increasing blood\\nglucose.\\nRegulation of Hormone Secretion\\nTo prevent abnormal hormone levels and a potential disease state, hormone levels must be tightly controlled. The\\nbody maintains this control by balancing hormone production and degradation. Feedback loops govern the initiation\\nand maintenance of most hormone secretion in response to various stimuli.\\nRole of Feedback Loops\\nThe contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are\\ncharacterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of\\noxytocin during childbirth is a positive feedback loop. The initial release of oxytocin begins to signal the uterine\\nmuscles to contract, which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the\\npituitary gland to release more oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases\\nafter the birth of the child.\\nThe more common method of hormone regulation is the negative feedback loop. Negative feedback is characterized\\nby the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone. This allows blood\\nlevels of the hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release\\nof glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. As\\nglucocorticoid concentrations in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the\\nadrenal glands to prevent additional glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6).\\n17.2 • Hormones 671'),\n",

This signaling is inhibited when glucocorticoid levels become elevated by causing negative signals to the\\npituitary gland and hypothalamus.\\nRole of Endocrine Gland Stimuli\\nReflexes triggered by both chemical and neural stimuli control endocrine activity. These reflexes may be simple,\\ninvolving only one hormone response, or they may be more complex and involve many hormones, as is the case with\\nthe hypothalamic control of various anterior pituitary–controlled hormones.\\nHumoral stimuli are changes in blood levels of non-hormone chemicals, such as nutrients or ions, which cause the\\nrelease or inhibition of a hormone to, in turn, maintain homeostasis. For example, osmoreceptors in the\\nhypothalamus detect changes in blood osmolarity (the concentration of solutes in the blood plasma). If blood\\nosmolarity is too high, meaning that the blood is not dilute enough, osmoreceptors signal the hypothalamus to\\nrelease ADH. The hormone causes the kidneys to reabsorb more water and reduce the volume of urine produced.\\nThis reabsorption causes a reduction of the osmolarity of the blood, diluting the blood to the appropriate level. The\\nregulation of blood glucose is another example. High blood glucose levels cause the release of insulin from the\\npancreas, which increases glucose uptake by cells and liver storage of glucose as glycogen.\\nAn endocrine gland may also secrete a hormone in response to the presence of another hormone produced by a\\ndifferent endocrine gland. Such hormonal stimuli often involve the hypothalamus, which produces releasing and\\ninhibiting hormones that control the secretion of a variety of pituitary hormones.\\nIn addition to these chemical signals, hormones can also be released in response to neural stimuli. A common\\nexample of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system.

This\\ncomplex secretes several hormones that directly produce responses in target tissues, as well as hormones that\\nregulate the synthesis and secretion of hormones of other glands. In addition, the hypothalamus–pituitary complex\\ncoordinates the messages of the endocrine and nervous systems. In many cases, a stimulus received by the nervous\\nsystem must pass through the hypothalamus–pituitary complex to be translated into hormones that can initiate a\\nresponse.\\nEveryday Connection\\nBisphenol A and Endocrine Disruption\\nYou may have heard news reports about the effects of a chemical called bisphenol A (BPA) in various types of\\nfood packaging. BPA is used in the manufacturing of hard plastics and epoxy resins. Common food-related items\\nthat may contain BPA include the lining of aluminum cans, plastic food-storage containers, drinking cups, as well\\nas baby bottles and “sippy” cups. Other uses of BPA include medical equipment, dental fillings, and the lining of\\nwater pipes.\\nResearch suggests that BPA is an endocrine disruptor, meaning that it negatively interferes with the endocrine\\nsystem, particularly during the prenatal and postnatal development period. In particular, BPA mimics the\\nhormonal effects of estrogens and has the opposite effect—that of androgens. The U.S. Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) notes in their statement about BPA safety that although traditional toxicology studies have\\nsupported the safety of low levels of exposure to BPA, recent studies using novel approaches to test for subtle\\neffects have led to some concern about the potential effects of BPA on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in\\nfetuses, infants, and young children. The FDA is currently facilitating decreased use of BPA in food-related\\nmaterials. Many US companies have voluntarily removed BPA from baby bottles, “sippy” cups, and the linings of\\ninfant formula cans, and most plastic reusable water bottles sold today boast that they are “BPA free.” In\\ncontrast, both Canada and the European Union have completely banned the use of BPA in baby products.\\nThe potential harmful effects of BPA have been studied in both animal models and humans and include a large\\nvariety of health effects, such as developmental delay and disease. For example, prenatal exposure to BPA\\nduring the first trimester of human pregnancy may be associated with wheezing and aggressive behavior during\\nchildhood. Adults exposed to high levels of BPA may experience altered thyroid signaling and male sexual\\ndysfunction. BPA exposure during the prenatal or postnatal period of development in animal models has been\\nobserved to cause neurological delays, changes in brain structure and function, sexual dysfunction, asthma, and\\nincreased risk for multiple cancers. In vitro studies have also shown that BPA exposure causes molecular\\nchanges that initiate the development of cancers of the breast, prostate, and brain. Although these studies have\\nimplicated BPA in numerous ill health effects, some experts caution that some of these studies may be flawed\\nand that more research needs to be done. In the meantime, the FDA recommends that consumers take\\nprecautions to limit their exposure to BPA. In addition to purchasing foods in packaging free of BPA, consumers\\nshould avoid carrying or storing foods or liquids in bottles with the recycling code 3 or 7. Foods and liquids\\nshould not be microwave-heated in any form of plastic: use paper, glass, or ceramics instead.\\n17.3 • The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus 673'),\n",

Throughout most of pregnancy, oxytocin hormone receptors are not\\nexpressed at high levels in the uterus. Toward the end of pregnancy, the synthesis of oxytocin receptors in the\\nuterus increases, and the smooth muscle cells of the uterus become more sensitive to its effects. Oxytocin is\\ncontinually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin\\nprompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates\\nadditional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary. This increases the\\nintensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop\\ncontinues until birth.\\nAlthough the high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues to play\\na role in female and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to\\nas “let-down”) in breastfeeding people. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit\\nsignals to the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds,\\ncells in the milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth. Secondly, in ball people, oxytocin is thought to\\ncontribute to parent–newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of\\nlove and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.\\nAntidiuretic Hormone (ADH)\\nThe solute concentration of the blood, or blood osmolarity, may change in response to the consumption of certain\\nfoods and fluids, as well as in response to disease, injury, medications, or other factors. Blood osmolarity is\\nconstantly monitored by osmoreceptors—specialized cells within the hypothalamus that are particularly sensitive to\\nthe concentration of sodium ions and other solutes.\\nIn response to high blood osmolarity, which can occur during dehydration or following a very salty meal, the\\nosmoreceptors signal the posterior pituitary to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The target cells of ADH are\\nlocated in the tubular cells of the kidneys. Its effect is to increase epithelial permeability to water, allowing\\nincreased water reabsorption. The more water reabsorbed from the filtrate, the greater the amount of water that is\\nreturned to the blood and the less that is excreted in the urine. A greater concentration of water results in a reduced\\nconcentration of solutes. ADH is also known as vasopressin because, in very high concentrations, it causes\\nconstriction of blood vessels, which increases blood pressure by increasing peripheral resistance. The release of\\nADH is controlled by a negative feedback loop. As blood osmolarity decreases, the hypothalamic osmoreceptors\\nsense the change and prompt a corresponding decrease in the secretion of ADH. As a result, less water is\\nreabsorbed from the urine filtrate.\\nInterestingly, drugs can affect the secretion of ADH. For example, alcohol consumption inhibits the release of ADH,\\nresulting in increased urine production that can eventually lead to dehydration and a hangover. A disease called\\ndiabetes insipidus is characterized by chronic underproduction of ADH that causes chronic dehydration. Because\\nlittle ADH is produced and secreted, not enough water is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Although patients feel thirsty,\\nand increase their fluid consumption, this doesn’t effectively decrease the solute concentration in their blood\\nbecause ADH levels are not high enough to trigger water reabsorption in the kidneys. Electrolyte imbalances can\\noccur in severe cases of diabetes insipidus.\\nAnterior Pituitary\\nThe anterior pituitary originates from the digestive tract in the embryo and migrates toward the brain during fetal\\ndevelopment. There are three regions: the pars distalis is the most anterior, the pars intermedia is adjacent to the\\nposterior pituitary, and the pars tuberalis is a slender “tube” that wraps the infundibulum.\\nRecall that the posterior pituitary does not synthesize hormones, but merely stores them. In contrast, the anterior\\npituitary does manufacture hormones. However, the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary is regulated\\nby two classes of hormones. These hormones—secreted by the hypothalamus—are the releasing hormones that\\nstimulate the secretion of hormones from the anterior pituitary and the inhibiting hormones that inhibit secretion.\\nHypothalamic hormones are secreted by neurons, but enter the anterior pituitary through blood vessels (Figure\\n17.9). Within the infundibulum is a bridge of capillaries that connects the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary.\\n676 17 • The Endocrine System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The system originates from the superior\\nhypophyseal artery, which branches off the carotid arteries and transports blood to the hypothalamus. The branches\\nof the superior hypophyseal artery form the hypophyseal portal system (see Figure 17.9). Hypothalamic releasing\\nand inhibiting hormones travel through a primary capillary plexus to the portal veins, which carry them into the\\nanterior pituitary. Hormones produced by the anterior pituitary (in response to releasing hormones) enter a\\nsecondary capillary plexus, and from there drain into the circulation.\\nFIGURE 17.9 Anterior Pituitary The anterior pituitary manufactures seven hormones. The hypothalamus produces separate hormones\\nthat stimulate or inhibit hormone production in the anterior pituitary. Hormones from the hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary via the\\nhypophyseal portal system.\\nThe anterior pituitary produces seven hormones. These are the growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone\\n(TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), beta\\nendorphin, and prolactin. Of the hormones of the anterior pituitary, TSH, ACTH, FSH, and LH are collectively referred\\nto as tropic hormones (trope- = “turning”) because they turn on or off the function of other endocrine glands.\\nGrowth Hormone\\nThe endocrine system regulates the growth of the human body, protein synthesis, and cellular replication. A major\\nhormone involved in this process is growth hormone (GH), also called somatotropin—a protein hormone produced\\nand secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Its primary function is anabolic; it promotes protein synthesis and\\ntissue building through direct and indirect mechanisms (Figure 17.10).

As a result, many tissues switch from glucose to fatty acids as their main energy source, which\\nmeans that less glucose is taken up from the bloodstream.\\nGH also initiates the diabetogenic effect in which GH stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to glucose, which\\nis then deposited into the blood. The name “diabetogenic” is derived from the similarity in elevated blood glucose\\nlevels observed between individuals with untreated diabetes mellitus and individuals experiencing GH excess.\\nBlood glucose levels rise as the result of a combination of glucose-sparing and diabetogenic effects.\\nGH indirectly mediates growth and protein synthesis by triggering the liver and other tissues to produce a group of\\nproteins called insulin-like growth factors (IGFs).

Skeletal muscle and cartilage cells are particularly sensitive to stimulation from IGFs.\\nDysfunction of the endocrine system’s control of growth can result in several disorders.

ACTH come from a\\nprecursor molecule known as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) which produces several biologically active molecules\\nwhen cleaved, including ACTH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the brain opioid peptides known as\\nendorphins.\\nThe release of ACTH is regulated by the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus in response\\nto normal physiologic rhythms. A variety of stressors can also influence its release, and the role of ACTH in the\\nstress response is discussed later in this chapter.\\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone\\nThe endocrine glands secrete a variety of hormones that control the development and regulation of the reproductive\\nsystem (these glands include the anterior pituitary, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads—the testes and the ovaries).\\nMuch of the development of the reproductive system occurs during puberty and is marked by the development of\\nsex-specific characteristics in adolescents. Puberty is initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a\\nhormone produced and secreted by the hypothalamus. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete\\ngonadotropins—hormones that regulate the function of the gonads. The levels of GnRH are regulated through a\\nnegative feedback loop; high levels of reproductive hormones inhibit the release of GnRH. Throughout life,\\ngonadotropins regulate reproductive function and, in the case of females, the onset and cessation of reproductive\\ncapacity.\\nThe gonadotropins include two glycoprotein hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the\\nproduction and maturation of sex cells, or gametes, including ova and sperm. FSH also promotes follicular growth;\\nthese follicles then release estrogens in ovaries. Luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers ovulation, as well as the\\nproduction of estrogens and progesterone by the ovaries. LH stimulates production of testosterone by the testes.\\nProlactin\\nAs its name implies, prolactin (PRL) promotes lactation (milk production). During pregnancy, it contributes to\\ndevelopment of the mammary glands, and after birth, it stimulates the mammary glands to produce breast milk.\\nHowever, the effects of prolactin depend heavily upon the permissive effects of estrogens, progesterone, and other\\nhormones. And as noted earlier, the let-down of milk occurs in response to stimulation from oxytocin.\\nIn non-pregnant females, prolactin secretion is inhibited by prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH), which is actually the\\nneurotransmitter dopamine, and is released from neurons in the hypothalamus. Only during pregnancy do prolactin\\nlevels rise in response to prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) from the hypothalamus.\\nIntermediate Pituitary: Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone\\nThe cells in the zone between the pituitary lobes secrete a hormone known as melanocyte-stimulating hormone\\n(MSH) that is formed by cleavage of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor protein. Local production of MSH in\\nthe skin is responsible for melanin production in response to UV light exposure. The role of MSH made by the\\npituitary is more complicated. For instance, people with lighter skin generally have the same amount of MSH as\\npeople with darker skin. Nevertheless, this hormone is capable of darkening of the skin by inducing melanin\\nproduction in the skin’s melanocytes. People also show increased MSH production during pregnancy; in combination\\nwith estrogens, it can lead to darker skin pigmentation, especially the skin of the areolas and labia minora.

Iodide ions then move to the lumen of the follicle cells that border the colloid. There, the ions undergo oxidation\\n(their negatively charged electrons are removed). The oxidation of two iodide ions (2 I–) results in iodine (I2),\\nwhich passes through the follicle cell membrane into the colloid.\\n3. In the colloid, peroxidase enzymes link the iodine to the tyrosine amino acids in thyroglobulin to produce two\\nintermediaries: a tyrosine attached to one iodine and a tyrosine attached to two iodines. When one of each of\\nthese intermediaries is linked by covalent bonds, the resulting compound is triiodothyronine (T3), a thyroid\\nhormone with three iodines. Much more commonly, two copies of the second intermediary bond, forming\\ntetraiodothyronine, also known as thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone with four iodines.\\nThese hormones remain in the colloid center of the thyroid follicles until TSH stimulates endocytosis of colloid back\\ninto the follicle cells.

T3\\nis more potent than T4, and many cells convert T4 to T3 through the removal of an iodine atom.\\nRegulation of TH Synthesis\\nThe release of T3 and T4 from the thyroid gland is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

When T3 and T4 cannot be produced, TSH is secreted in increasing amounts. As a result of this\\nhyperstimulation, thyroglobulin accumulates in the thyroid gland follicles, increasing their deposits of colloid.\\nThe accumulation of colloid increases the overall size of the thyroid gland, a condition called a goiter (Figure\\n17.14). A goiter is only a visible indication of the deficiency. Other iodine deficiency disorders include impaired\\ngrowth and development, decreased fertility, and prenatal and infant death.

The adrenal glands have a rich blood supply and experience one of the highest rates\\nof blood flow in the body. They are served by several arteries branching off the aorta, including the suprarenal and\\nrenal arteries. Blood flows to each adrenal gland at the adrenal cortex and then drains into the adrenal medulla.\\nAdrenal hormones are released into the circulation via the left and right suprarenal veins.\\nFIGURE 17.17 Adrenal Glands Both adrenal glands sit atop the kidneys and are composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla, all\\nsurrounded by a connective tissue capsule. The cortex can be subdivided into additional zones, all of which produce different types of\\nhormones. LM × 204.

The cortex\\nitself is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata, and the zona reticularis. Each region\\nsecretes its own set of hormones.\\nThe adrenal cortex, as a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, secretes steroid hormones\\nimportant for the regulation of the long-term stress response, blood pressure and blood volume, nutrient uptake\\nand storage, fluid and electrolyte balance, and inflammation. The HPA axis involves the stimulation of hormone\\nrelease of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary by the hypothalamus. ACTH then stimulates the\\nadrenal cortex to produce the hormone cortisol. This pathway will be discussed in more detail below.\\nThe adrenal medulla is neuroendocrine tissue composed of postganglionic sympathetic nervous system (SNS)\\nneurons. It is really an extension of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates homeostasis in the body. The\\nsympathomedullary (SAM) pathway involves the stimulation of the medulla by impulses from the hypothalamus via\\nneurons from the thoracic spinal cord. The medulla is stimulated to secrete the amine hormones epinephrine and\\nnorepinephrine.\\nOne of the major functions of the adrenal gland is to respond to stress. Stress can be either physical or psychological\\nor both. Physical stresses include exposing the body to injury, walking outside in cold and wet conditions without a\\ncoat on, or malnutrition.

Stage one of GAS is called the alarm reaction. This is short-term stress, the\\nfight-or-flight response, mediated by the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla via\\nthe SAM pathway. Their function is to prepare the body for extreme physical exertion. Once this stress is relieved,\\nthe body quickly returns to normal. The section on the adrenal medulla covers this response in more detail.\\nIf the stress is not soon relieved, the body adapts to the stress in the second stage called the stage of resistance. If\\na person is starving for example, the body may send signals to the gastrointestinal tract to maximize the absorption\\nof nutrients from food.\\nIf the stress continues for a longer term however, the body responds with symptoms quite different than the fight-\\nor-flight response. During the stage of exhaustion, individuals may begin to suffer depression, the suppression of\\ntheir immune response, severe fatigue, or even a fatal heart attack. These symptoms are mediated by the hormones\\nof the adrenal cortex, especially cortisol, released as a result of signals from the HPA axis.\\nAdrenal hormones also have several non–stress-related functions, including the increase of blood sodium and\\nglucose levels, which will be described in detail below.\\nAdrenal Cortex\\nThe adrenal cortex consists of multiple layers of lipid-storing cells that occur in three structurally distinct regions.\\nEach of these regions produces different hormones.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/adrenalglands) to view an animation describing the location and function of the\\nadrenal glands. Which hormone produced by the adrenal glands is responsible for the mobilization of energy stores?\\nHormones of the Zona Glomerulosa\\nThe most superficial region of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa, which produces a group of hormones\\ncollectively referred to as mineralocorticoids because of their effect on body minerals, especially sodium and\\npotassium. These hormones are essential for fluid and electrolyte balance.\\nAldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid. It is important in the regulation of the concentration of sodium and\\npotassium ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. For example, it is released in response to elevated blood K+, low blood\\nNa+, low blood pressure, or low blood volume. In response, aldosterone increases the excretion of K+ and the\\nretention of Na+, which in turn increases blood volume and blood pressure. Its secretion is prompted when CRH\\nfrom the hypothalamus triggers ACTH release from the anterior pituitary.\\nAldosterone is also a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in which specialized cells\\nof the kidneys secrete the enzyme renin in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure. Renin then\\ncatalyzes the conversion of the blood protein angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to the hormone angiotensin I.\\nAngiotensin I is converted in the lungs to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II\\nhas three major functions:\\n1. Initiating vasoconstriction of the arterioles, decreasing blood flow\\n2. Stimulating kidney tubules to reabsorb NaCl and water, increasing blood volume\\n3. Signaling the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, the effects of which further contribute to fluid retention,\\nrestoring blood pressure and blood volume\\nFor individuals with hypertension, or high blood pressure, drugs are available that block the production of\\nangiotensin II. These drugs, known as ACE inhibitors, block the ACE enzyme from converting angiotensin I to\\nangiotensin II, thus mitigating the latter’s ability to increase blood pressure.\\nHormones of the Zona Fasciculata\\nThe intermediate region of the adrenal cortex is the zona fasciculata, named as such because the cells form small\\nfascicles (bundles) separated by tiny blood vessels. The cells of the zona fasciculata produce hormones called\\nglucocorticoids because of their role in glucose metabolism. The most important of these is cortisol, some of which\\nthe liver converts to cortisone. A glucocorticoid produced in much smaller amounts is corticosterone. In response to\\nlong-term stressors, the hypothalamus secretes CRH, which in turn triggers the release of ACTH by the anterior\\n17.6 • The Adrenal Glands 689'),\n",

Their overall effect is to inhibit tissue building while\\nstimulating the breakdown of stored nutrients to maintain adequate fuel supplies. In conditions of long-term stress,\\nfor example, cortisol promotes the catabolism of glycogen to glucose, the catabolism of stored triglycerides into\\nfatty acids and glycerol, and the catabolism of muscle proteins into amino acids. These raw materials can then be\\nused to synthesize additional glucose and ketones for use as body fuels. The hippocampus, which is part of the\\ntemporal lobe of the cerebral cortices and important in memory formation, is highly sensitive to stress levels\\nbecause of its many glucocorticoid receptors.\\nYou are probably familiar with prescription and over-the-counter medications containing glucocorticoids, such as\\ncortisone injections into inflamed joints, prednisone tablets and steroid-based inhalers used to manage severe\\nasthma, and hydrocortisone creams applied to relieve itchy rashes. These drugs reflect another role of cortisol—the\\ndownregulation of the immune system, which inhibits the inflammatory response.\\nHormones of the Zona Reticularis\\nThe deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis, which produces small amounts of a class of steroid\\nsex hormones called androgens. During puberty and most of adulthood, androgens are produced in the gonads. The\\nandrogens produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens. They are produced in response to\\nACTH from the anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or estrogens. In adult females,\\nthey may contribute to the sex drive, but their function in adult males is not well understood. In post-menopausal\\npeople, as the functions of the ovaries decline, the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by\\nthe zona reticularis.\\nAdrenal Medulla\\nAs noted earlier, the adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids in response to long-term stress such as severe illness.\\nIn contrast, the adrenal medulla releases its hormones in response to acute, short-term stress mediated by the\\nsympathetic nervous system (SNS).\\nThe medullary tissue is composed of unique postganglionic SNS neurons called chromaffin cells, which are large\\nand irregularly shaped, and produce the neurotransmitters epinephrine (also called adrenaline) and\\nnorepinephrine (or noradrenaline). Epinephrine is produced in greater quantities—approximately a 4 to 1 ratio with\\nnorepinephrine—and is the more powerful hormone. Because the chromaffin cells release epinephrine and\\nnorepinephrine into the systemic circulation, where they travel widely and exert effects on distant cells, they are\\nconsidered hormones. Derived from the amino acid tyrosine, they are chemically classified as catecholamines.\\nThe secretion of medullary epinephrine and norepinephrine is controlled by a neural pathway that originates from\\nthe hypothalamus in response to danger or stress (the SAM pathway). Both epinephrine and norepinephrine signal\\nthe liver and skeletal muscle cells to convert glycogen into glucose, resulting in increased blood glucose levels.\\nThese hormones increase the heart rate, pulse, and blood pressure to prepare the body to fight the perceived threat\\nor flee from it. In addition, the pathway dilates the airways, raising blood oxygen levels. It also prompts vasodilation,\\nfurther increasing the oxygenation of important organs such as the lungs, brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. At the\\nsame time, it triggers vasoconstriction to blood vessels serving less essential organs such as the gastrointestinal\\ntract, kidneys, and skin, and downregulates some components of the immune system. Other effects include a dry\\nmouth, loss of appetite, pupil dilation, and a loss of peripheral vision.

For example,\\nCushing’s disease is a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels and the accumulation of lipid deposits on\\nthe face and neck. It is caused by hypersecretion of cortisol. The most common source of Cushing’s disease is a\\npituitary tumor that secretes cortisol or ACTH in abnormally high amounts. Other common signs of Cushing’s\\ndisease include the development of a moon-shaped face, a buffalo hump on the back of the neck, rapid weight gain,\\nand hair loss. Chronically elevated glucose levels are also associated with an elevated risk of developing type 2\\ndiabetes. In addition to hyperglycemia, chronically elevated glucocorticoids compromise immunity, resistance to\\ninfection, and memory, and can result in rapid weight gain and hair loss.\\nIn contrast, the hyposecretion of corticosteroids can result in Addison’s disease, a rare disorder that causes low\\nblood glucose levels and low blood sodium levels. The signs and symptoms of Addison’s disease are vague and are\\ntypical of other disorders as well, making diagnosis difficult. They may include general weakness, abdominal pain,\\nweight loss, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and cravings for salty food.\\n17.7 The Pineal Gland\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the location and structure of the pineal gland\\n• Discuss the function of melatonin\\nRecall that the hypothalamus, part of the diencephalon of the brain, sits inferior and somewhat anterior to the\\nthalamus. Inferior but somewhat posterior to the thalamus is the pineal gland, a tiny endocrine gland whose\\nfunctions are not entirely clear. The pinealocyte cells that make up the pineal gland are known to produce and\\nsecrete the amine hormone melatonin, which is derived from serotonin.\\nThe secretion of melatonin varies according to the level of light received from the environment. When photons of\\nlight stimulate the retinas of the eyes, a nerve impulse is sent to a region of the hypothalamus called the\\nsuprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is important in regulating biological rhythms. From the SCN, the nerve signal\\nis carried to the spinal cord and eventually to the pineal gland, where the production of melatonin is inhibited. As a\\nresult, blood levels of melatonin fall, promoting wakefulness. In contrast, as light levels decline—such as during the\\nevening—melatonin production increases, boosting blood levels and causing drowsiness.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/melatonin) to view an animation describing the function of the hormone\\nmelatonin. What should you avoid doing in the middle of your sleep cycle that would lower melatonin?\\nThe secretion of melatonin may influence the body’s circadian rhythms, the dark-light fluctuations that affect not\\nonly sleepiness and wakefulness, but also appetite and body temperature. Interestingly, children have higher\\nmelatonin levels than adults, which may prevent the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary, thereby\\ninhibiting the onset of puberty.

The roles of the gonadotropins released from the anterior\\npituitary (FSH and LH) were discussed earlier.\\nThe primary hormone produced by the testes is testosterone, a steroid hormone important in the development of\\nthe testicular reproductive system, the maturation of sperm cells, and the development of secondary sex\\ncharacteristics such as a deepened voice, body hair, and increased muscle mass. Interestingly, testosterone is also\\nproduced in the ovaries, but at a much reduced level. In addition, the testes produce the peptide hormone inhibin,\\nwhich inhibits the secretion of FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis.\\nThe primary hormones produced by the ovaries are estrogens, which include estradiol, estriol, and estrone.\\nEstrogens play an important role in a larger number of physiological processes, including the development of the\\novarian reproductive system, regulation of the menstrual cycle, the development of secondary sex characteristics\\nsuch as increased adipose tissue and the development of breast tissue, and the maintenance of pregnancy. Another\\nsignificant ovarian hormone is progesterone, which contributes to regulation of the menstrual cycle and is\\nimportant in preparing the body for pregnancy as well as maintaining pregnancy. In addition, the granulosa cells of\\nthe ovarian follicles produce inhibin, which inhibits the secretion of FSH.During the initial stages of pregnancy, an\\norgan called the placenta develops within the uterus. The placenta supplies oxygen and nutrients to the fetus,\\nexcretes waste products, and produces and secretes estrogens and progesterone. The placenta produces human\\nchorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as well. The hCG hormone promotes progesterone synthesis and reduces the\\nmother’s immune function to protect the fetus from immune rejection. It also secretes human placental lactogen\\n(hPL), which plays a role in preparing the breasts for lactation, and relaxin, which is thought to help soften and\\nwiden the pubic symphysis in preparation for childbirth.

By boosting natural levels of this hormone, athletes experience increased muscle mass. Synthetic\\nversions of human growth hormone are also used to build muscle mass.\\nThe use of performance-enhancing drugs is banned by all major collegiate and professional sports organizations\\nin the United States because they impart an unfair advantage to athletes who take them. In addition, the drugs\\ncan cause significant and dangerous side effects. For example, anabolic steroid use can increase cholesterol\\nlevels, raise blood pressure, and damage the liver. Altered testosterone levels (both too low or too high) have\\nbeen implicated in causing structural damage to the heart, and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart\\nattacks, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Paradoxically, steroids can have effects, including shriveled\\ntesticles and enlarged breast tissue. In females, their use can cause effects such as an enlarged clitoris and\\ngrowth of facial hair.

In response, the alpha cells of the pancreas secrete the hormone\\nglucagon, which has several effects:\\n• It stimulates the liver to convert its stores of glycogen back into glucose. This response is known as\\nglycogenolysis. The glucose is then released into the circulation for use by body cells.\\n• It stimulates the liver to take up amino acids from the blood and convert them into glucose. This response is\\nknown as gluconeogenesis.\\n• It stimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol.

Here, you will learn about the hormone-producing activities of the heart,\\ngastrointestinal tract, kidneys, skeleton, adipose tissue, skin, and thymus.\\nHeart\\nWhen the body experiences an increase in blood volume or pressure, the cells of the heart’s atrial wall stretch. In\\nresponse, specialized cells in the wall of the atria produce and secrete the peptide hormone atrial natriuretic\\nType 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95 percent of all cases. It is acquired, and lifestyle factors such as\\npoor diet, inactivity, and the presence of pre-diabetes greatly increase a person’s risk. About 80 to 90 percent of\\npeople with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. In type 2 diabetes, cells become resistant to the effects of\\ninsulin. In response, the pancreas increases its insulin secretion, but over time, the beta cells become\\nexhausted. In many cases, type 2 diabetes can be reversed by moderate weight loss, regular physical activity,\\nand consumption of a healthy diet; however, if blood glucose levels cannot be controlled, the person with\\ndiabetes will eventually require insulin.\\nTwo of the early manifestations of diabetes are excessive urination and excessive thirst. They demonstrate how\\nthe out-of-control levels of glucose in the blood affect kidney function. The kidneys are responsible for filtering\\nglucose from the blood. Excessive blood glucose draws water into the urine, and as a result the person\\neliminates an abnormally large quantity of sweet urine. The use of body water to dilute the urine leaves the body\\ndehydrated, and so the person is unusually and continually thirsty. The person may also experience persistent\\nhunger because the body cells are unable to access the glucose in the bloodstream.\\nOver time, persistently high levels of glucose in the blood injure tissues throughout the body, especially those of\\nthe blood vessels and nerves. Inflammation and injury of the lining of arteries lead to atherosclerosis and an\\nincreased risk of heart attack and stroke. Damage to the microscopic blood vessels of the kidney impairs kidney\\nfunction and can lead to kidney failure. Damage to blood vessels that serve the eyes can lead to blindness.\\nBlood vessel damage also reduces circulation to the limbs, whereas nerve damage leads to a loss of sensation,\\ncalled neuropathy, particularly in the hands and feet. Together, these changes increase the risk of injury,\\ninfection, and tissue death (necrosis), contributing to a high rate of toe, foot, and lower leg amputations in\\npeople with diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can also lead to a dangerous form of metabolic acidosis called\\nketoacidosis. Deprived of glucose, cells increasingly rely on fat stores for fuel. However, in a glucose-deficient\\nstate, the liver is forced to use an alternative lipid metabolism pathway that results in the increased production\\nof ketone bodies (or ketones), which are acidic. The build-up of ketones in the blood causes ketoacidosis,\\nwhich—if left untreated—may lead to a life-threatening “diabetic coma.” Together, these complications make\\ndiabetes the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.\\nDiabetes is diagnosed when lab tests reveal that blood glucose levels are higher than normal, a condition called\\nhyperglycemia. The treatment of diabetes depends on the type, the severity of the condition, and the ability of\\nthe patient to make lifestyle changes. As noted earlier, moderate weight loss, regular physical activity, and\\nconsumption of a healthful diet can reduce blood glucose levels. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may be\\nunable to control their disease with these lifestyle changes, and will require medication. Historically, the first-\\nline treatment of type 2 diabetes was insulin. Research advances have resulted in alternative options, including\\nmedications that enhance pancreatic function.\\n17.10 • Organs with Secondary Endocrine Functions 697'),\n",

ANP signals the kidneys to reduce sodium reabsorption, thereby decreasing the amount of water\\nreabsorbed from the urine filtrate and reducing blood volume. Other actions of ANP include the inhibition of renin\\nsecretion, thus inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and vasodilation. Therefore, ANP aids\\nin decreasing blood pressure, blood volume, and blood sodium levels.\\nGastrointestinal Tract\\nThe endocrine cells of the GI tract are located in the mucosa of the stomach and small intestine. Some of these\\nhormones are secreted in response to eating a meal and aid in digestion. An example of a hormone secreted by the\\nstomach cells is gastrin, a peptide hormone secreted in response to stomach distention that stimulates the release\\nof hydrochloric acid. Secretin is a peptide hormone secreted by the small intestine as acidic chyme (partially\\ndigested food and fluid) moves from the stomach. It stimulates the release of bicarbonate from the pancreas, which\\nbuffers the acidic chyme, and inhibits the further secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach. Cholecystokinin\\n(CCK) is another peptide hormone released from the small intestine. It promotes the secretion of pancreatic\\nenzymes and the release of bile from the gallbladder, both of which facilitate digestion. Other hormones produced\\nby the intestinal cells aid in glucose metabolism, such as by stimulating the pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin,\\nreducing glucagon secretion from the alpha cells, or enhancing cellular sensitivity to insulin.\\nKidneys\\nThe kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones. A decline in blood\\nflow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin, triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\\n(RAAS) system, and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water. The reabsorption increases blood flow and\\nblood pressure. The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol\\nfrom vitamin D3, which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). In addition, the\\nkidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in response to low oxygen levels. EPO stimulates the\\nproduction of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the bone marrow, thereby increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. You\\nmay have heard of EPO as a performance-enhancing drug (in a synthetic form).\\nSkeleton\\nAlthough bone has long been recognized as a target for hormones, only recently have researchers recognized that\\nthe skeleton itself produces at least two hormones. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is produced by bone cells in\\nresponse to increased blood levels of vitamin D3 or phosphate. It triggers the kidneys to inhibit the formation of\\ncalcitriol from vitamin D3 and to increase phosphorus excretion. Osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts, stimulates\\nthe pancreatic beta cells to increase insulin production. It also acts on peripheral tissues to increase their sensitivity\\nto insulin and their utilization of glucose.\\nAdipose Tissue\\nAdipose tissue produces and secretes several hormones involved in lipid metabolism and storage. One important\\nexample is leptin, a protein manufactured by adipose cells that circulates in amounts directly proportional to levels\\nof body fat. Leptin is released in response to food consumption and acts by binding to brain neurons involved in\\nenergy intake and expenditure. Binding of leptin produces a feeling of satiety after a meal, thereby reducing\\nappetite. It also appears that the binding of leptin to brain receptors triggers the sympathetic nervous system to\\nregulate bone metabolism, increasing deposition of cortical bone. Adiponectin—another hormone synthesized by\\nadipose cells—appears to reduce cellular insulin resistance and to protect blood vessels from inflammation and\\natherosclerosis. Its levels are lower in people who are obese, and rise following weight loss.\\nSkin\\nThe skin functions as an endocrine organ in the production of the inactive form of vitamin D3, cholecalciferol. When\\ncholesterol present in the epidermis is exposed to ultraviolet radiation, it is converted to cholecalciferol, which then\\nenters the blood. In the liver, cholecalciferol is converted to an intermediate that travels to the kidneys and is further\\nconverted to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3. Vitamin D is important in a variety of physiological processes,\\nincluding intestinal calcium absorption and immune system function. In some studies, low levels of vitamin D have\\nbeen associated with increased risks of cancer, severe asthma, and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D deficiency in\\nchildren causes rickets, and in adults, osteomalacia—both of which are characterized by bone deterioration.\\n698 17 • The Endocrine System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The endocrine glands that produce the steroid\\nhormones, such as the gonads and adrenal cortex, arise from the mesoderm. In contrast, endocrine glands that\\narise from the endoderm and ectoderm produce the amine, peptide, and protein hormones. The pituitary gland\\narises from two distinct areas of the ectoderm: the anterior pituitary gland arises from the oral ectoderm, whereas\\nthe posterior pituitary gland arises from the neural ectoderm at the base of the hypothalamus. The pineal gland also\\narises from the ectoderm. The two structures of the adrenal glands arise from two different germ layers: the adrenal\\ncortex from the mesoderm and the adrenal medulla from ectoderm neural cells. The endoderm gives rise to the\\nthyroid and parathyroid glands, as well as the pancreas and the thymus.\\nAs the body ages, changes occur that affect the endocrine system, sometimes altering the production, secretion,\\nand catabolism of hormones. For example, the structure of the anterior pituitary gland changes as vascularization\\ndecreases and the connective tissue content increases with increasing age. This restructuring affects the gland’s\\nhormone production. For example, the amount of human growth hormone that is produced declines with age,\\nresulting in the reduced muscle mass commonly observed in the elderly.\\nThe adrenal glands also undergo changes as the body ages; as fibrous tissue increases, the production of cortisol\\nand aldosterone decreases. Interestingly, the production and secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine remain\\nnormal throughout the aging process.\\nA well-known example of the aging process affecting an endocrine gland is menopause and the decline of ovarian\\nfunction. With increasing age, the ovaries decrease in both size and weight and become progressively less sensitive\\nto gonadotropins. This gradually causes a decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels, leading to menopause and\\nthe inability to reproduce. Low levels of estrogens and progesterone are also associated with some disease states,\\nsuch as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, and hyperlipidemia, or abnormal blood lipid levels.\\nTestosterone levels also decline with age, a condition called andropause (or viropause); however, this decline is\\nmuch less dramatic than the decline of estrogens, and much more gradual, rarely affecting sperm production until\\nvery old age. Although this means that males maintain their ability to produce offspring for decades longer than\\nfemales, the quantity, quality, and motility of their sperm is often reduced.\\nAs the body ages, the thyroid gland produces less of the thyroid hormones, causing a gradual decrease in the basal\\nmetabolic rate. The lower metabolic rate reduces the production of body heat and increases levels of body fat.\\nParathyroid hormones, on the other hand, increase with age. This may be because of reduced dietary calcium levels,\\ncausing a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone. However, increased parathyroid hormone levels\\ncombined with decreased levels of calcitonin (and estrogens in females) can lead to osteoporosis as PTH stimulates\\ndemineralization of bones to increase blood calcium levels. Notice that osteoporosis is common in all elderly people\\nregardless of sex.\\n700 17 • The Endocrine System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Neural\\ncommunication includes both electrical and chemical\\nsignaling between neurons and target cells. Endocrine\\ncommunication involves chemical signaling via the\\nrelease of hormones into the extracellular fluid. From\\nthere, hormones diffuse into the bloodstream and may\\ntravel to distant body regions, where they elicit a\\nresponse in target cells. Endocrine glands are ductless\\nglands that secrete hormones. Many organs of the body\\nwith other primary functions—such as the heart,\\nstomach, and kidneys—also have hormone-secreting\\ncells.\\n17.2 Hormones\\nHormones are derived from amino acids or lipids.\\nAmine hormones originate from the amino acids\\ntryptophan or tyrosine. Larger amino acid hormones\\ninclude peptides and protein hormones. Steroid\\nhormones are derived from cholesterol.\\nSteroid hormones and thyroid hormone are lipid\\nsoluble. All other amino acid–derived hormones are\\nwater soluble. Hydrophobic hormones are able to\\ndiffuse through the membrane and interact with an\\nintracellular receptor.

This initiates a signaling cascade that involves\\na second messenger, such as cyclic adenosine\\nmonophosphate (cAMP). Second messenger systems\\ngreatly amplify the hormone signal, creating a broader,\\nmore efficient, and faster response.\\nHormones are released upon stimulation that is of\\neither chemical or neural origin. Regulation of hormone\\nrelease is primarily achieved through negative\\nfeedback. Various stimuli may cause the release of\\nhormones, but there are three major types. Humoral\\nstimuli are changes in ion or nutrient levels in the\\nblood. Hormonal stimuli are changes in hormone levels\\nthat initiate or inhibit the secretion of another\\nhormone. Finally, a neural stimulus occurs when a\\nnerve impulse prompts the secretion or inhibition of a\\nhormone.\\n17.3 The Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus\\nThe hypothalamus–pituitary complex is located in the\\ndiencephalon of the brain. The hypothalamus and the\\npituitary gland are connected by a structure called the\\ninfundibulum, which contains vasculature and nerve\\naxons. The pituitary gland is divided into two distinct\\nstructures with different embryonic origins. The\\nposterior lobe houses the axon terminals of\\nhypothalamic neurons. It stores and releases into the\\nbloodstream two hypothalamic hormones: oxytocin\\nand antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The anterior lobe is\\nconnected to the hypothalamus by vasculature in the\\ninfundibulum and produces and secretes six\\nhormones. Their secretion is regulated, however, by\\nreleasing and inhibiting hormones from the\\nhypothalamus. The six anterior pituitary hormones are:\\ngrowth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone\\n(TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-\\nstimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH),\\nand prolactin (PRL).\\n17.4 The Thyroid Gland\\nThe thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located in\\nthe neck anterior to the trachea. Its hormones regulate\\nbasal metabolism, oxygen use, nutrient metabolism,\\nthe production of ATP, and calcium homeostasis. They\\nalso contribute to protein synthesis and the normal\\ngrowth and development of body tissues, including\\nmaturation of the nervous system, and they increase\\nthe body’s sensitivity to catecholamines. The thyroid\\nhormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are\\nproduced and secreted by the thyroid gland in\\nresponse to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from\\nthe anterior pituitary. Synthesis of the amino\\nacid–derived T3 and T4 hormones requires iodine.\\nInsufficient amounts of iodine in the diet can lead to\\ngoiter, cretinism, and many other disorders.\\n17.5 The Parathyroid Glands\\nCalcium is required for a variety of important\\nphysiologic processes, including neuromuscular\\nfunctioning; thus, blood calcium levels are closely\\nregulated. The parathyroid glands are small structures\\nlocated on the posterior thyroid gland that produce\\nparathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates blood\\ncalcium levels. Low blood calcium levels cause the\\nproduction and secretion of PTH. In contrast, elevated\\nblood calcium levels inhibit secretion of PTH and\\ntrigger secretion of the thyroid hormone calcitonin.\\nUnderproduction of PTH can result in\\nhypoparathyroidism. In contrast, overproduction of\\nPTH can result in hyperparathyroidism.\\n17.6 The Adrenal Glands\\nThe adrenal glands, located superior to each kidney,\\nconsist of two regions: the adrenal cortex and adrenal\\nmedulla. The adrenal cortex—the outer layer of the\\ngland—produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids,\\nand androgens. The adrenal medulla at the core of the\\ngland produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.\\nThe adrenal glands mediate a short-term stress\\nresponse and a long-term stress response. A perceived\\nthreat results in the secretion of epinephrine and\\nnorepinephrine from the adrenal medulla, which\\nmediate the fight-or-flight response. The long-term\\nstress response is mediated by the secretion of CRH\\nfrom the hypothalamus, which triggers ACTH, which in\\nturn stimulates the secretion of corticosteroids from\\nthe adrenal cortex. The mineralocorticoids, chiefly\\naldosterone, cause sodium and fluid retention, which\\nincreases blood volume and blood pressure.\\n17.7 The Pineal Gland\\nThe pineal gland is an endocrine structure of the\\ndiencephalon of the brain, and is located inferior and\\nposterior to the thalamus. It is made up of\\npinealocytes. These cells produce and secrete the\\nhormone melatonin in response to low light levels.\\nHigh blood levels of melatonin induce drowsiness. Jet\\nlag, caused by traveling across several time zones,\\noccurs because melatonin synthesis takes several days\\nto readjust to the light-dark patterns in the new\\nenvironment.\\n17 • Chapter Review 705'),\n",

FSH stimulates sperm\\nmaturation, which is inhibited by the hormone inhibin.\\nThe steroid hormone testosterone, a type of androgen,\\nis released in response to LH and is responsible for the\\nmaturation and maintenance of the testicular\\nreproductive system, as well as the development of\\nsecondary sex characteristics.

The pancreatic islet cell types include alpha\\ncells, which produce glucagon; beta cells, which\\nproduce insulin; delta cells, which produce\\nsomatostatin; and PP cells, which produce pancreatic\\npolypeptide. Insulin and glucagon are involved in the\\nregulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin is produced\\nby the beta cells in response to high blood glucose\\nlevels. It enhances glucose uptake and utilization by\\ntarget cells, as well as the storage of excess glucose for\\nlater use. Dysfunction of the production of insulin or\\ntarget cell resistance to the effects of insulin causes\\ndiabetes mellitus, a disorder characterized by high\\nblood glucose levels. The hormone glucagon is\\nproduced and secreted by the alpha cells of the\\npancreas in response to low blood glucose levels.\\nGlucagon stimulates mechanisms that increase blood\\nglucose levels, such as the catabolism of glycogen into\\nglucose.\\n17.10 Organs with Secondary Endocrine\\nFunctions\\nSome organs have a secondary endocrine function. For\\nexample, the walls of the atria of the heart produce the\\nhormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), the\\ngastrointestinal tract produces the hormones gastrin,\\nsecretin, and cholecystokinin, which aid in digestion,\\nand the kidneys produce erythropoietin (EPO), which\\nstimulates the formation of red blood cells.

In general, different\\nhormone classes arise from distinct germ layers. Aging\\naffects the endocrine glands, potentially affecting\\nhormone production and secretion, and can cause\\ndisease.

The cellular elements—referred to as the formed elements—include red blood cells (RBCs),\\nwhite blood cells (WBCs), and cell fragments called platelets. The extracellular matrix, called plasma, makes\\nblood unique among connective tissues because it is fluid. This fluid, which is mostly water, perpetually suspends\\nthe formed elements and enables them to circulate throughout the body within the cardiovascular system.\\nFunctions of Blood\\nThe primary function of blood is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to and remove wastes from body cells, but that is\\nonly the beginning of the story. The specific functions of blood also include defense, distribution of heat, and\\nmaintenance of homeostasis.\\nTransportation\\nNutrients from the foods you eat are absorbed in the digestive tract. Most of these travel in the bloodstream directly\\nto the liver, where they are processed and released back into the bloodstream for delivery to body cells. Oxygen\\nfrom the air you breathe diffuses into the blood, which moves from the lungs to the heart, which then pumps it out\\nto the rest of the body. Moreover, endocrine glands scattered throughout the body release their products, called\\nhormones, into the bloodstream, which carries them to distant target cells. Blood also picks up cellular wastes and\\nbyproducts, and transports them to various organs for removal. For instance, blood moves carbon dioxide to the\\nlungs for exhalation from the body, and various waste products are transported to the kidneys and liver for excretion\\nfrom the body in the form of urine or bile.\\nDefense\\nMany types of WBCs protect the body from external threats, such as disease-causing bacteria that have entered the\\nbloodstream in a wound. Other WBCs seek out and destroy internal threats, such as cells with mutated DNA that\\ncould multiply to become cancerous, or body cells infected with viruses.\\nWhen damage to the vessels results in bleeding, blood platelets and certain proteins dissolved in the plasma, the\\nfluid portion of the blood, interact to block the ruptured areas of the blood vessels involved. This protects the body\\nfrom further blood loss.\\nMaintenance of Homeostasis\\nRecall that body temperature is regulated via a classic negative-feedback loop. If you were exercising on a warm\\nday, your rising core body temperature would trigger several homeostatic mechanisms, including increased\\ntransport of blood from your core to your body periphery, which is typically cooler. As blood passes through the\\nvessels of the skin, heat would be dissipated to the environment, and the blood returning to your body core would\\nbe cooler. In contrast, on a cold day, blood is diverted away from the skin to maintain a warmer body core. In\\nextreme cases, this may result in frostbite.\\nBlood also helps to maintain the chemical balance of the body. Proteins and other compounds in blood act as\\nbuffers, which thereby help to regulate the pH of body tissues. Blood also helps to regulate the water content of\\nbody cells.\\nComposition of Blood\\nYou have probably had blood drawn from a superficial vein in your arm, which was then sent to a lab for analysis.\\nSome of the most common blood tests—for instance, those measuring lipid or glucose levels in plasma—determine\\nwhich substances are present within blood and in what quantities. Other blood tests check for the composition of\\nthe blood itself, including the quantities and types of formed elements.\\nOne such test, called a hematocrit, measures the percentage of RBCs, clinically known as erythrocytes, in a blood\\nsample. It is performed by spinning the blood sample in a specialized centrifuge, a process that causes the heavier\\nelements suspended within the blood sample to separate from the lightweight, liquid plasma (Figure 18.2). Because\\nthe heaviest elements in blood are the erythrocytes, these settle at the very bottom of the hematocrit tube. Located\\nabove the erythrocytes is a pale, thin layer composed of the remaining formed elements of blood. These are the\\nWBCs, clinically known as leukocytes, and the platelets, cell fragments also called thrombocytes. This layer is\\nreferred to as the buffy coat because of its color; it normally constitutes less than 1 percent of a blood sample.\\nAbove the buffy coat is the blood plasma, normally a pale, straw-colored fluid, which constitutes the remainder of\\nthe sample.\\n712 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In\\nnormal blood, about 45 percent of a sample is erythrocytes. The hematocrit of any one sample can vary significantly,\\nhowever, about 36–50 percent, according to gender and other factors. Normal hematocrit values for females range\\nfrom 37 to 47, with a mean value of 41; for males, hematocrit ranges from 42 to 52, with a mean of 47. The\\npercentage of other formed elements, the WBCs and platelets, is extremely small so it is not normally considered\\nwith the hematocrit. So the mean plasma percentage is the percent of blood that is not erythrocytes: for females, it\\nis approximately 59 (or 100 minus 41), and for males, it is approximately 53 (or 100 minus 47).\\nFIGURE 18.2 Composition of Blood The cellular elements of blood include a vast number of erythrocytes and comparatively fewer\\nleukocytes and platelets. Plasma is the fluid in which the formed elements are suspended. A sample of blood spun in a centrifuge reveals\\nthat plasma is the lightest component. It floats at the top of the tube separated from the heaviest elements, the erythrocytes, by a buffy\\ncoat of leukocytes and platelets. Hematocrit is the percentage of the total sample that is comprised of erythrocytes. Depressed and\\nelevated hematocrit levels are shown for comparison.\\nCharacteristics of Blood\\nWhen you think about blood, the first characteristic that probably comes to mind is its color. Blood that has just\\ntaken up oxygen in the lungs is bright red, and blood that has released oxygen in the tissues is a more dusky red.\\nThis is because hemoglobin is a pigment that changes color, depending upon the degree of oxygen saturation.\\nBlood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch. It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water.\\nViscosity is a measure of a fluid’s thickness or resistance to flow, and is influenced by the presence of the plasma\\nproteins and formed elements within the blood. The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and\\nflow. Consider the difference in flow between water and honey. The more viscous honey would demonstrate a\\ngreater resistance to flow than the less viscous water. The same principle applies to blood.\\nThe normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature—about 38 °C (or 100.4 °F),\\ncompared to 37 °C (or 98.6 °F) for an internal body temperature reading, although daily variations of 0.5 °C are\\nnormal. Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth, as blood flows through them, it experiences\\nsome friction and resistance, especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity, thereby producing heat. This\\naccounts for its slightly higher temperature.\\nThe pH of blood averages about 7.4; however, it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person. Blood is therefore\\nsomewhat more basic (alkaline) on a chemical scale than pure water, which has a pH of 7.0. Blood contains\\nnumerous buffers that actually help to regulate pH.\\nBlood constitutes approximately 8 percent of adult body weight. Adult males typically average about 5 to 6 liters of\\nblood. Females average 4–5 liters.\\nBlood Plasma\\nLike other fluids in the body, plasma is composed primarily of water: In fact, it is about 92 percent water. Dissolved\\nor suspended within this water is a mixture of substances, most of which are proteins. There are literally hundreds\\nof substances dissolved or suspended in the plasma, although many of them are found only in very small quantities.\\n18.1 • An Overview of Blood 713'),\n",

Serum, one of the specimen types included, refers to a sample of plasma after clotting\\nfactors have been removed. What types of measurements are given for levels of glucose in the blood?\\nPlasma Proteins\\nAbout 7 percent of the volume of plasma—nearly all that is not water—is made of proteins. These include several\\nplasma proteins (proteins that are unique to the plasma), plus a much smaller number of regulatory proteins,\\nincluding enzymes and some hormones. The major components of plasma are summarized in Figure 18.3.\\nThe three major groups of plasma proteins are as follows:\\n• Albumin is the most abundant of the plasma proteins. Manufactured by the liver, albumin molecules serve as\\nbinding proteins—transport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid hormones. Recall that lipids are hydrophobic;\\nhowever, their binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma. Albumin is also the most\\nsignificant contributor to the osmotic pressure of blood; that is, its presence holds water inside the blood\\nvessels and draws water from the tissues, across blood vessel walls, and into the bloodstream. This in turn\\nhelps to maintain both blood volume and blood pressure. Albumin normally accounts for approximately 54\\npercent of the total plasma protein content, in clinical levels of 3.5–5.0 g/dL blood.\\n• The second most common plasma proteins are the globulins. A heterogeneous group, there are three main\\nsubgroups known as alpha, beta, and gamma globulins. The alpha and beta globulins transport iron, lipids, and\\nthe fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K to the cells; like albumin, they also contribute to osmotic pressure. The\\ngamma globulins are proteins involved in immunity and are better known as an antibodies or\\nimmunoglobulins. Although other plasma proteins are produced by the liver, immunoglobulins are produced by\\nspecialized leukocytes known as plasma cells. (Seek additional content for more information about\\nimmunoglobulins.) Globulins make up approximately 38 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical\\nlevels of 1.0–1.5 g/dL blood.\\n• Fibrinogen is the third of the three major groups of plasma proteins. Like albumin and the alpha and beta\\nglobulins, fibrinogen is produced by the liver. It is essential for blood clotting, a process described later in this\\nchapter. Fibrinogen accounts for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein volume, in clinical levels of\\n0.2–0.45 g/dL blood.\\nOther Plasma Solutes\\nIn addition to proteins, plasma contains a wide variety of other substances. These include various electrolytes, such\\nas sodium, potassium, and calcium ions; dissolved gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; various\\norganic nutrients, such as vitamins, lipids, glucose, and amino acids; and metabolic wastes. All of these nonprotein\\nsolutes combined contribute approximately 1 percent to the total volume of plasma.\\n714 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

They perform a wide variety of tests on various\\nbody fluids, including blood. The information they provide is essential to the primary care providers in\\ndetermining a diagnosis and in monitoring the course of a disease and response to treatment.\\n• Medical laboratory technicians (MLT) typically have an associate’s degree but may perform duties similar to\\nthose of an MT.\\n• Medical laboratory assistants (MLA) spend the majority of their time processing samples and carrying out\\nroutine assignments within the lab. Clinical training is required, but a degree may not be essential to obtaining a\\nposition.\\n18.2 Production of the Formed Elements\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Trace the generation of the formed elements of blood from bone marrow stem cells\\n• Discuss the role of hemopoietic growth factors in promoting the production of the formed elements\\nThe lifespan of the formed elements is very brief. Although one type of leukocyte called memory cells can survive for\\nyears, most erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets normally live only a few hours to a few weeks. Thus, the body\\nmust form new blood cells and platelets quickly and continuously. When you donate a unit of blood during a blood\\ndrive (approximately 475 mL, or about 1 pint), your body typically replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours, but\\nit takes about 4 to 6 weeks to replace the blood cells. This restricts the frequency with which donors can contribute\\ntheir blood. The process by which this replacement occurs is called hemopoiesis, or hematopoiesis (from the Greek\\nroot haima- = “blood”; -poiesis = “production”).\\nSites of Hemopoiesis\\nPrior to birth, hemopoiesis occurs in a number of tissues, beginning with the yolk sac of the developing embryo, and\\ncontinuing in the fetal liver, spleen, lymphatic tissue, and eventually the red bone marrow. Following birth, most\\nhemopoiesis occurs in the red marrow, a connective tissue within the spaces of spongy (cancellous) bone tissue. In\\nchildren, hemopoiesis can occur in the medullary cavity of long bones; in adults, the process is largely restricted to\\nthe cranial and pelvic bones, the vertebrae, the sternum, and the proximal epiphyses of the femur and humerus.\\nThroughout adulthood, the liver and spleen maintain their ability to generate the formed elements. This process is\\nreferred to as extramedullary hemopoiesis (meaning hemopoiesis outside the medullary cavity of adult bones).\\nWhen a disease such as bone cancer destroys the bone marrow, causing hemopoiesis to fail, extramedullary\\nhemopoiesis may be initiated.\\nDifferentiation of Formed Elements from Stem Cells\\nAll formed elements arise from stem cells of the red bone marrow. Recall that stem cells undergo mitosis plus\\ncytokinesis (cellular division) to give rise to new daughter cells: One of these remains a stem cell and the other\\ndifferentiates into one of any number of diverse cell types. Stem cells may be viewed as occupying a hierarchal\\nsystem, with some loss of the ability to diversify at each step. The totipotent stem cell is the zygote, or fertilized\\negg. The totipotent (toti- = “all”) stem cell gives rise to all cells of the human body. The next level is the pluripotent\\nstem cell, which gives rise to multiple types of cells of the body and some of the supporting fetal membranes.\\nBeneath this level, the mesenchymal cell is a stem cell that develops only into types of connective tissue, including\\nfibrous connective tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood, but not epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue. One step lower\\non the hierarchy of stem cells is the hematopoietic stem cell, or hemocytoblast. All of the formed elements of\\nblood originate from this specific type of cell.\\nHemopoiesis begins when the hematopoietic stem cell is exposed to appropriate chemical stimuli collectively called\\nhemopoietic growth factors, which prompt it to divide and differentiate. One daughter cell remains a hematopoietic\\nstem cell, allowing hemopoiesis to continue. The other daughter cell becomes either of two types of more\\n716 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

However, hemopoiesis of lymphocytes\\nprogresses somewhat differently from the process for the other formed elements. In brief, lymphoid stem cells\\nquickly migrate from the bone marrow to lymphatic tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus,\\nwhere their production and differentiation continues. B cells are so named since they mature in the bone\\nmarrow, while T cells mature in the thymus.\\n• Myeloid stem cells give rise to all the other formed elements, including the erythrocytes; megakaryocytes that\\nproduce platelets; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular\\nleukocytes: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.\\nFIGURE 18.4 Hematopoietic System of Bone Marrow Hemopoiesis is the proliferation and differentiation of the formed elements of\\nblood.\\nLymphoid and myeloid stem cells do not immediately divide and differentiate into mature formed elements.

For instance, megakaryoblasts are the\\nprecursors of megakaryocytes, and proerythroblasts become reticulocytes, which eject their nucleus and most\\nother organelles before maturing into erythrocytes.\\nHemopoietic Growth Factors\\nDevelopment from stem cells to precursor cells to mature cells is again initiated by hemopoietic growth factors.\\nThese include the following:\\n• Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the interstitial fibroblast cells of the kidneys in\\nresponse to low oxygen levels.

What\\nare the some potential side effects of blood doping?\\nBone Marrow Sampling and Transplants\\nSometimes, a healthcare provider will order a bone marrow biopsy, a diagnostic test of a sample of red bone\\nEveryday Connection\\nBlood Doping\\nIn its original intent, the term blood doping was used to describe the practice of injecting by transfusion\\nsupplemental RBCs into an individual, typically to enhance performance in a sport. Additional RBCs would\\ndeliver more oxygen to the tissues, providing extra aerobic capacity, clinically referred to as VO2 max. The source\\nof the cells was either from the recipient (autologous) or from a donor with compatible blood (homologous). This\\npractice was aided by the well-developed techniques of harvesting, concentrating, and freezing of the RBCs that\\ncould be later thawed and injected, yet still retain their functionality. These practices are considered illegal in\\nvirtually all sports and run the risk of infection, significantly increasing the viscosity of the blood and the\\npotential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens if the blood was collected from another individual.\\nWith the development of synthetic EPO in the 1980s, it became possible to provide additional RBCs by\\nartificially stimulating RBC production in the bone marrow. Originally developed to treat patients suffering from\\nanemia, renal failure, or cancer treatment, large quantities of EPO can be generated by recombinant DNA\\ntechnology. Synthetic EPO is injected under the skin and can increase hematocrit for many weeks. It may also\\ninduce polycythemia and raise hematocrit to 70 or greater. This increased viscosity raises the resistance of the\\nblood and forces the heart to pump more powerfully; in extreme cases, it has resulted in death. Other drugs\\nsuch as cobalt II chloride have been shown to increase natural EPO gene expression. Blood doping has become\\nproblematic in many sports, especially cycling. Lance Armstrong, winner of seven Tour de France and many\\nother cycling titles, was stripped of his victories and admitted to blood doping in 2013.\\n718 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These tests and procedures are often used to assist in the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of various severe forms of anemia, such as thalassemia major and sickle cell anemia, as\\nwell as some types of cancer, specifically leukemia.\\nIn the past, when a bone marrow sample or transplant was necessary, the procedure would have required inserting\\na large-bore needle into the region near the iliac crest of the pelvic bones (os coxae). This location was preferred,\\nsince its location close to the body surface makes it more accessible, and it is relatively isolated from most vital\\norgans. Unfortunately, the procedure is quite painful.\\nNow, direct sampling of bone marrow can often be avoided. In many cases, stem cells can be isolated in just a few\\nhours from a sample of a patient’s blood. The isolated stem cells are then grown in culture using the appropriate\\nhemopoietic growth factors, and analyzed or sometimes frozen for later use.\\nFor an individual requiring a transplant, a matching donor is essential to prevent the immune system from\\ndestroying the donor cells—a phenomenon known as tissue rejection.

Specifically, males have\\nabout 5.4 million erythrocytes per microliter (µL) of blood, and females have approximately 4.8 million per µL. In\\nfact, erythrocytes are estimated to make up about 25 percent of the total cells in the body. As you can imagine, they\\nare quite small cells, with a mean diameter of only about 7–8 micrometers (µm) (Figure 18.5). The primary functions\\nof erythrocytes are to pick up inhaled oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the body’s tissues, and to pick up\\nsome (about 24 percent) carbon dioxide waste at the tissues and transport it to the lungs for exhalation.\\nErythrocytes remain within the vascular network. Although leukocytes typically leave the blood vessels to perform\\ntheir defensive functions, movement of erythrocytes from the blood vessels is abnormal.\\n18.3 • Erythrocytes 719'),\n",

During\\nthe first day or two that it is in the circulation, an immature erythrocyte, known as a reticulocyte, will still typically\\ncontain remnants of organelles. Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1–2 percent of the erythrocyte count\\nand provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production, with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations\\nin the production of these cells. These remnants, primarily of networks (reticulum) of ribosomes, are quickly shed,\\nhowever, and mature, circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components. Lacking\\nmitochondria, for example, they rely on anaerobic respiration. This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen\\nthey are transporting, so they can deliver it all to the tissues. They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not\\nsynthesize proteins. Erythrocytes do, however, contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain\\ntheir unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries. This includes the\\nprotein spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein element.\\nErythrocytes are biconcave disks; that is, they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center (Figure 18.6).\\nSince they lack most organelles, there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that, as\\nyou will see shortly, transport gases. The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas\\nexchange can occur, relative to its volume; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-\\nvolume ratio. In the capillaries, the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through\\nthe capillary walls to reach the cells, whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product\\ndiffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes. Capillary beds are extremely narrow, slowing the\\npassage of the erythrocytes and providing an extended opportunity for gas exchange to occur. However, the space\\nwithin capillaries can be so minute that, despite their own small size, erythrocytes may have to fold in on\\nthemselves if they are to make their way through. Fortunately, their structural proteins like spectrin are flexible,\\nallowing them to bend over themselves to a surprising degree, then spring back again when they enter a wider\\nvessel. In wider vessels, erythrocytes may stack up much like a roll of coins, forming a rouleaux, from the French\\nword for “roll.”\\nFIGURE 18.6 Shape of Red Blood Cells Erythrocytes are biconcave discs with very shallow centers. This shape optimizes the ratio of\\nsurface area to volume, facilitating gas exchange. It also enables them to fold up as they move through narrow blood vessels.\\nHemoglobin\\nHemoglobin is a large molecule made up of proteins and iron.

Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red\\npigment molecule called heme, which contains an ion of iron (Fe2+) (Figure 18.7b).\\nFIGURE 18.7 Hemoglobin (a) A molecule of hemoglobin contains four globin proteins, each of which is bound to one molecule of the\\niron-containing pigment heme. (b) A single erythrocyte can contain 300 million hemoglobin molecules, and thus more than 1 billion oxygen\\nmolecules.\\nEach iron ion in the heme can bind to one oxygen molecule; therefore, each hemoglobin molecule can transport four\\noxygen molecules. An individual erythrocyte may contain about 300 million hemoglobin molecules, and therefore\\ncan bind to and transport up to 1.2 billion oxygen molecules (see Figure 18.7b).\\nIn the lungs, hemoglobin picks up oxygen, which binds to the iron ions, forming oxyhemoglobin. The bright red,\\noxygenated hemoglobin travels to the body tissues, where it releases some of the oxygen molecules, becoming\\ndarker red deoxyhemoglobin, sometimes referred to as reduced hemoglobin. Oxygen release depends on the need\\nfor oxygen in the surrounding tissues, so hemoglobin rarely if ever leaves all of its oxygen behind. In the capillaries,\\ncarbon dioxide enters the bloodstream. About 76 percent dissolves in the plasma, some of it remaining as dissolved\\nCO2, and the remainder forming bicarbonate ion. About 23–24 percent of it binds to the amino acids in hemoglobin,\\nforming a molecule known as carbaminohemoglobin. From the capillaries, the hemoglobin carries carbon dioxide\\nback to the lungs, where it releases it for exchange of oxygen.\\nChanges in the levels of RBCs can have significant effects on the body’s ability to effectively deliver oxygen to the\\ntissues. Ineffective hematopoiesis results in insufficient numbers of RBCs and results in one of several forms of\\nanemia. An overproduction of RBCs produces a condition called polycythemia. The primary drawback with\\npolycythemia is not a failure to directly deliver enough oxygen to the tissues, but rather the increased viscosity of\\nthe blood, which makes it more difficult for the heart to circulate the blood.\\nIn patients with insufficient hemoglobin, the tissues may not receive sufficient oxygen, resulting in another form of\\nanemia. In determining oxygenation of tissues, the value of greatest interest in healthcare is the percent saturation;\\nthat is, the percentage of hemoglobin sites occupied by oxygen in a patient’s blood. Clinically this value is commonly\\nreferred to simply as “percent sat.”\\nPercent saturation is normally monitored using a device known as a pulse oximeter, which is applied to a thin part of\\nthe body, typically the tip of the patient’s finger. The device works by sending two different wavelengths of light (one\\nred, the other infrared) through the finger and measuring the light with a photodetector as it exits. Hemoglobin\\nabsorbs light differentially depending upon its saturation with oxygen. The machine calibrates the amount of light\\nreceived by the photodetector against the amount absorbed by the partially oxygenated hemoglobin and presents\\nthe data as percent saturation. Normal pulse oximeter readings range from 95–100 percent. Lower percentages\\nreflect hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen. The term hypoxia is more generic and simply refers to low oxygen levels.\\nOxygen levels are also directly monitored from free oxygen in the plasma typically following an arterial stick. When\\nthis method is applied, the amount of oxygen present is expressed in terms of partial pressure of oxygen or simply\\nPO2 or PO2 and is typically recorded in units of millimeters of mercury, mm Hg.\\n722 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In response to\\nhypoxemia, less oxygen will exit the vessels supplying the kidney, resulting in hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) in\\nthe tissue fluid of the kidney where oxygen concentration is actually monitored. Interstitial fibroblasts within the\\nkidney secrete EPO, thereby increasing erythrocyte production and restoring oxygen levels. In a classic negative-\\nfeedback loop, as oxygen saturation rises, EPO secretion falls, and vice versa, thereby maintaining homeostasis.\\nPopulations dwelling at high elevations, with inherently lower levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, naturally maintain\\na hematocrit higher than people living at sea level. Consequently, people traveling to high elevations may experience\\nsymptoms of hypoxemia, such as fatigue, headache, and shortness of breath, for a few days after their arrival. In\\nresponse to the hypoxemia, the kidneys secrete EPO to step up the production of erythrocytes until homeostasis is\\nachieved once again. To avoid the symptoms of hypoxemia, or altitude sickness, mountain climbers typically rest for\\nseveral days to a week or more at a series of camps situated at increasing elevations to allow EPO levels and,\\nconsequently, erythrocyte counts to rise. When climbing the tallest peaks, such as Mt. Everest and K2 in the\\nHimalayas, many mountain climbers rely upon bottled oxygen as they near the summit.\\nLifecycle of Erythrocytes\\nProduction of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per second. For\\nthis production to occur, a number of raw materials must be present in adequate amounts. These include the same\\nnutrients that are essential to the production and maintenance of any cell, such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids.\\nHowever, erythrocyte production also requires several trace elements:\\n• Iron. We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron. On\\naverage, less than 20 percent of the iron we consume is absorbed. Heme iron, from animal foods such as meat,\\npoultry, and fish, is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods. Upon absorption, iron\\nbecomes part of the body’s total iron pool. The bone marrow, liver, and spleen can store iron in the protein\\ncompounds ferritin and hemosiderin. Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma\\nmembranes and from its storage sites into tissue fluid where it enters the blood. When EPO stimulates the\\nproduction of erythrocytes, iron is released from storage, bound to transferrin, and carried to the red marrow\\nwhere it attaches to erythrocyte precursors.\\n• Copper. A trace mineral, copper is a component of two plasma proteins, hephaestin and ceruloplasmin. Without\\nthese, hemoglobin could not be adequately produced. Located in intestinal villi, hephaestin enables iron to be\\nabsorbed by intestinal cells. Ceruloplasmin transports copper. Both enable the oxidation of iron from Fe2+ to\\nFe3+, a form in which it can be bound to its transport protein, transferrin, for transport to body cells. In a state\\nof copper deficiency, the transport of iron for heme synthesis decreases, and iron can accumulate in tissues,\\nwhere it can eventually lead to organ damage.\\n• Zinc. The trace mineral zinc functions as a co-enzyme that facilitates the synthesis of the heme portion of\\nhemoglobin.\\n• B vitamins. The B vitamins folate and vitamin B12 function as co-enzymes that facilitate DNA synthesis. Thus,\\nboth are critical for the synthesis of new cells, including erythrocytes.\\nErythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation, after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid\\nphagocytic cell called a macrophage, located primarily within the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. The components\\nof the degraded erythrocytes’ hemoglobin are further processed as follows:\\n• Globin, the protein portion of hemoglobin, is broken down into amino acids, which can be sent back to the bone\\nmarrow to be used in the production of new erythrocytes. Hemoglobin that is not phagocytized is broken down\\nin the circulation, releasing alpha and beta chains that are removed from circulation by the kidneys.\\n• The iron contained in the heme portion of hemoglobin may be stored in the liver or spleen, primarily in the form\\nof ferritin or hemosiderin, or carried through the bloodstream by transferrin to the red bone marrow for\\nrecycling into new erythrocytes.\\n• The non-iron portion of heme is degraded into the waste product biliverdin, a green pigment, and then into\\nanother waste product, bilirubin, a yellow pigment. Bilirubin binds to albumin and travels in the blood to the\\nliver, which uses it in the manufacture of bile, a compound released into the intestines to help emulsify dietary\\nfats. In the large intestine, bacteria breaks the bilirubin apart from the bile and converts it to urobilinogen and\\nthen into stercobilin. It is then eliminated from the body in the feces.

The kidneys also remove any circulating\\nbilirubin and other related metabolic byproducts such as urobilins and secrete them into the urine.\\nThe breakdown pigments formed from the destruction of hemoglobin can be seen in a variety of situations. At the\\nsite of an injury, biliverdin from damaged RBCs produces some of the dramatic colors associated with a bruise. With\\na failing liver, bilirubin cannot be removed effectively from circulation and causes the body to assume a yellowish\\ntinge associated with jaundice. Stercobilins within the feces produce the typical brown color associated with this\\nwaste.

Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis: The\\nkinetic approach focuses on evaluating the production, destruction, and removal of RBCs, whereas the\\nmorphological approach examines the RBCs themselves, paying particular emphasis to their size. A common test is\\nthe mean corpuscle volume (MCV), which measures size. Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic, smaller-\\nthan-normal cells are referred to as microcytic, and larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic.\\nReticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate production of RBCs. The effects of the various\\nanemias are widespread, because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin will result in lower levels of oxygen\\nbeing delivered to body tissues. Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning, anemia produces fatigue, lethargy,\\nand an increased risk for infection. An oxygen deficit in the brain impairs the ability to think clearly, and may prompt\\nheadaches and irritability. Lack of oxygen leaves the patient short of breath, even as the heart and lungs work harder\\nin response to the deficit.\\nBlood loss anemias are fairly straightforward. In addition to bleeding from wounds or other lesions, these forms of\\nanemia may be due to ulcers, hemorrhoids, inflammation of the stomach (gastritis), and some cancers of the\\ngastrointestinal tract. The excessive use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen\\ncan trigger ulceration and gastritis. Excessive menstruation and loss of blood during childbirth are also potential\\ncauses.\\nAnemias caused by faulty or decreased RBC production include sickle cell anemia, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin\\ndeficiency anemia, and diseases of the bone marrow and stem cells.\\n• A characteristic change in the shape of erythrocytes is seen in sickle cell disease (also referred to as sickle cell\\nanemia). A genetic disorder, it is caused by production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S,\\nwhich delivers less oxygen to tissues and causes erythrocytes to assume a sickle (or crescent) shape, especially\\nat low oxygen concentrations (Figure 18.9). These abnormally shaped cells can then become lodged in narrow\\ncapillaries because they are unable to fold in on themselves to squeeze through, blocking blood flow to tissues\\nand causing a variety of serious problems from painful joints to delayed growth and even blindness and\\ncerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Sickle cell anemia is a genetic condition particularly found in individuals of\\nAfrican descent.\\nFIGURE 18.9 Sickle Cells Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in one of the hemoglobin genes. Erythrocytes produce an\\nabnormal type of hemoglobin, which causes the cell to take on a sickle or crescent shape.

Additionally, iron\\ndeficiency anemia may be caused by either an inability to absorb and transport iron or slow, chronic bleeding.\\n• Vitamin-deficient anemias generally involve insufficient vitamin B12 and folate.\\n◦ Megaloblastic anemia involves a deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folate, and often involves diets deficient in\\nthese essential nutrients. Lack of meat or a viable alternate source, and overcooking or eating insufficient\\namounts of vegetables may lead to a lack of folate.\\n◦ Pernicious anemia is caused by poor absorption of vitamin B12 and is often seen in patients with Crohn’s\\ndisease (a severe intestinal disorder often treated by surgery), surgical removal of the intestines or stomach\\n(common in some weight loss surgeries), intestinal parasites, and AIDS.\\n◦ Pregnancies, some medications, excessive alcohol consumption, and some diseases such as celiac disease\\nare also associated with vitamin deficiencies. It is essential to provide sufficient folic acid during the early\\nstages of pregnancy to reduce the risk of neurological defects, including spina bifida, a failure of the neural\\ntube to close.\\n• Assorted disease processes can also interfere with the production and formation of RBCs and hemoglobin. If\\nmyeloid stem cells are defective or replaced by cancer cells, there will be insufficient quantities of RBCs\\nproduced.\\n◦ Aplastic anemia is the condition in which there are deficient numbers of RBC stem cells. Aplastic anemia is\\noften inherited, or it may be triggered by radiation, medication, chemotherapy, or infection.\\n◦ Thalassemia is an inherited condition typically occurring in individuals from the Middle East, the\\nMediterranean, African, and Southeast Asia, in which maturation of the RBCs does not proceed normally. The\\nmost severe form is called Cooley’s anemia.\\n◦ Lead exposure from industrial sources or even dust from paint chips of iron-containing paints or pottery that\\nhas not been properly glazed may also lead to destruction of the red marrow.\\n• Various disease processes also can lead to anemias. These include chronic kidney diseases often associated\\nwith a decreased production of EPO, hypothyroidism, some forms of cancer, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\\nIn contrast to anemia, an elevated RBC count is called polycythemia and is detected in a patient’s elevated\\nhematocrit. It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated; when water intake is inadequate or water losses\\nare excessive, the plasma volume falls. As a result, the hematocrit rises. For reasons mentioned earlier, a mild form\\nof polycythemia is chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes. Some elite athletes train at high elevations\\nspecifically to induce this phenomenon. Finally, a type of bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera (from the\\nGreek vera = “true”) causes an excessive production of immature erythrocytes. Polycythemia vera can dangerously\\nelevate the viscosity of blood, raising blood pressure and making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood\\nthroughout the body. It is a relatively rare disease that occurs more often in males than in females, and is more\\nlikely to be present in elderly patients those over 60 years of age.\\n18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the general characteristics of leukocytes\\n• Classify leukocytes according to their lineage, their main structural features, and their primary functions\\n• Discuss the most common malignancies involving leukocytes\\n• Identify the lineage, basic structure, and function of platelets\\nThe leukocyte, commonly known as a white blood cell (or WBC), is a major component of the body’s defenses\\nagainst disease.

And although there is just one type\\nof erythrocyte, there are many types of leukocytes. Most of these types have a much shorter lifespan than that of\\nerythrocytes, some as short as a few hours or even a few minutes in the case of acute infection.\\nOne of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement. Whereas erythrocytes spend their days\\ncirculating within the blood vessels, leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions\\nin the body’s tissues. For leukocytes, the vascular network is simply a highway they travel and soon exit to reach\\ntheir true destination. When they arrive, they are often given distinct names, such as macrophage or microglia,\\ndepending on their function. As shown in Figure 18.10, they leave the capillaries—the smallest blood vessels—or\\nother small vessels through a process known as emigration (from the Latin for “removal”) or diapedesis (dia- =\\n“through”; -pedan = “to leap”) in which they squeeze through adjacent cells in a blood vessel wall.\\nOnce they have exited the capillaries, some leukocytes will take up fixed positions in lymphatic tissue, bone marrow,\\nthe spleen, the thymus, or other organs. Others will move about through the tissue spaces very much like amoebas,\\ncontinuously extending their plasma membranes, sometimes wandering freely, and sometimes moving toward the\\ndirection in which they are drawn by chemical signals. This attracting of leukocytes occurs because of positive\\nchemotaxis (literally “movement in response to chemicals”), a phenomenon in which injured or infected cells and\\nnearby leukocytes emit the equivalent of a chemical “911” call, attracting more leukocytes to the site. In clinical\\nmedicine, the differential counts of the types and percentages of leukocytes present are often key indicators in\\nmaking a diagnosis and selecting a treatment.\\n728 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Older neutrophils have increasing numbers of lobes\\nand are often referred to as polymorphonuclear (a nucleus with many forms), or simply “polys.” Younger and\\nimmature neutrophils begin to develop lobes and are known as “bands.”\\nNeutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria.\\nTheir granules include lysozyme, an enzyme capable of lysing, or breaking down, bacterial cell walls; oxidants such\\nas hydrogen peroxide; and defensins, proteins that bind to and puncture bacterial and fungal plasma membranes,\\nso that the cell contents leak out. Abnormally high counts of neutrophils indicate infection and/or inflammation,\\nparticularly triggered by bacteria, but are also found in burn patients and others experiencing unusual stress. A burn\\ninjury increases the proliferation of neutrophils in order to fight off infection that can result from the destruction of\\nthe barrier of the skin. Low counts may be caused by drug toxicity and other disorders, and may increase an\\nindividual’s susceptibility to infection.\\nEosinophils typically represent 2–4 percent of total leukocyte count. They are also 10–12 µm in diameter. The\\ngranules of eosinophils stain best with an acidic stain known as eosin. The nucleus of the eosinophil will typically\\nhave two to three lobes and, if stained properly, the granules will have a distinct red to orange color.\\nThe granules of eosinophils include antihistamine molecules, which counteract the activities of histamines,\\ninflammatory chemicals produced by basophils and mast cells. Some eosinophil granules contain molecules toxic to\\nparasitic worms, which can enter the body through the integument, or when an individual consumes raw or\\nundercooked fish or meat. Eosinophils are also capable of phagocytosis and are particularly effective when\\nantibodies bind to the target and form an antigen-antibody complex. High counts of eosinophils are typical of\\npatients experiencing allergies, parasitic worm infestations, and some autoimmune diseases. Low counts may be\\ndue to drug toxicity and stress.\\nBasophils are the least common leukocytes, typically comprising less than one percent of the total leukocyte count.\\nThey are slightly smaller than neutrophils and eosinophils at 8–10 µm in diameter. The granules of basophils stain\\nbest with basic (alkaline) stains. Basophils contain large granules that pick up a dark blue stain and are so common\\nthey may make it difficult to see the two-lobed nucleus.\\nIn general, basophils intensify the inflammatory response.

High counts of basophils are associated with allergies, parasitic infections, and hypothyroidism. Low counts\\nare associated with pregnancy, stress, and hyperthyroidism.\\nAgranular Leukocytes\\nAgranular leukocytes contain smaller, less-visible granules in their cytoplasm than do granular leukocytes. The\\nnucleus is simple in shape, sometimes with an indentation but without distinct lobes. There are two major types of\\nagranulocytes: lymphocytes and monocytes (see Figure 18.4).\\nLymphocytes are the only formed element of blood that arises from lymphoid stem cells. Although they form\\ninitially in the bone marrow, much of their subsequent development and reproduction occurs in the lymphatic\\ntissues. Lymphocytes are the second most common type of leukocyte, accounting for about 20–30 percent of all\\nleukocytes, and are essential for the immune response. The size range of lymphocytes is quite extensive, with some\\nauthorities recognizing two size classes and others three. Typically, the large cells are 10–14 µm and have a smaller\\nnucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and more granules. The smaller cells are typically 6–9 µm with a larger volume of\\nnucleus to cytoplasm, creating a “halo” effect. A few cells may fall outside these ranges, at 14–17 µm. This finding\\nhas led to the three size range classification.\\nThe three major groups of lymphocytes include natural killer cells, B cells, and T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are\\ncapable of recognizing cells that do not express “self” proteins on their plasma membrane or that contain foreign or\\nabnormal markers. These “nonself” cells include cancer cells, cells infected with a virus, and other cells with\\natypical surface proteins. Thus, they provide generalized, nonspecific immunity. The larger lymphocytes are typically\\nNK cells.\\nB cells and T cells, also called B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, play prominent roles in defending the body\\nagainst specific pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) and are involved in specific immunity. One form of B\\ncells (plasma cells) produces the antibodies or immunoglobulins that bind to specific foreign or abnormal\\ncomponents of plasma membranes. This is also referred to as humoral (body fluid) immunity. T cells provide\\ncellular-level immunity by physically attacking foreign or diseased cells. A memory cell is a variety of both B and T\\ncells that forms after exposure to a pathogen and mounts rapid responses upon subsequent exposures. Unlike other\\nleukocytes, memory cells live for many years. B cells undergo a maturation process in the bone marrow, whereas T\\ncells undergo maturation in the thymus. This site of the maturation process gives rise to the name B and T cells. The\\nfunctions of lymphocytes are complex and will be covered in detail in the chapter covering the lymphatic system and\\nimmunity. Smaller lymphocytes are either B or T cells, although they cannot be differentiated in a normal blood\\nsmear.\\nAbnormally high lymphocyte counts are characteristic of viral infections as well as some types of cancer. Abnormally\\nlow lymphocyte counts are characteristic of prolonged (chronic) illness or immunosuppression, including that\\ncaused by HIV infection and drug therapies that often involve steroids.\\nMonocytes originate from myeloid stem cells. They normally represent 2–8 percent of the total leukocyte count.\\nThey are typically easily recognized by their large size of 12–20 µm and indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei.\\nMacrophages are monocytes that have left the circulation and phagocytize debris, foreign pathogens, worn-out\\nerythrocytes, and many other dead, worn out, or damaged cells. Macrophages also release antimicrobial defensins\\nand chemotactic chemicals that attract other leukocytes to the site of an infection. Some macrophages occupy fixed\\nlocations, whereas others wander through the tissue fluid.\\nAbnormally high counts of monocytes are associated with viral or fungal infections, tuberculosis, and some forms of\\nleukemia and other chronic diseases. Abnormally low counts are typically caused by suppression of the bone\\nmarrow.\\nLifecycle of Leukocytes\\nMost leukocytes have a relatively short lifespan, typically measured in hours or days. Production of all leukocytes\\nbegins in the bone marrow under the influence of CSFs and interleukins. Secondary production and maturation of\\nlymphocytes occurs in specific regions of lymphatic tissue known as germinal centers. Lymphocytes are fully\\n18.4 • Leukocytes and Platelets 731'),\n",

This capacity enables an individual to\\nmaintain immunity throughout life to many threats that have been encountered in the past.\\nDisorders of Leukocytes\\nLeukopenia is a condition in which too few leukocytes are produced. If this condition is pronounced, the individual\\nmay be unable to ward off disease. Excessive leukocyte proliferation is known as leukocytosis. Although leukocyte\\ncounts are high, the cells themselves are often nonfunctional, leaving the individual at increased risk for disease.\\nLeukemia is a cancer involving an abundance of leukocytes. It may involve only one specific type of leukocyte from\\neither the myeloid line (myelocytic leukemia) or the lymphoid line (lymphocytic leukemia). In chronic leukemia,\\nmature leukocytes accumulate and fail to die. In acute leukemia, there is an overproduction of young, immature\\nleukocytes. In both conditions the cells do not function properly.\\nLymphoma is a form of cancer in which masses of malignant T and/or B lymphocytes collect in lymph nodes, the\\nspleen, the liver, and other tissues. As in leukemia, the malignant leukocytes do not function properly, and the\\npatient is vulnerable to infection. Some forms of lymphoma tend to progress slowly and respond well to treatment.\\nOthers tend to progress quickly and require aggressive treatment, without which they are rapidly fatal.\\nPlatelets\\nYou may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes, but because this name suggests they are a type of\\ncell, it is not accurate. A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte\\nthat is surrounded by a plasma membrane. Megakaryocytes are descended from myeloid stem cells (see Figure\\n18.4) and are large, typically 50–100 µm in diameter, and contain an enlarged, lobed nucleus. As noted earlier,\\nthrombopoietin, a glycoprotein secreted by the kidneys and liver, stimulates the proliferation of megakaryoblasts,\\nwhich mature into megakaryocytes. These remain within bone marrow tissue (Figure 18.12) and ultimately form\\nplatelet-precursor extensions that extend through the walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the\\ncirculation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments, each enclosed by a bit of plasma membrane. These enclosed\\nfragments are platelets. Each megakarocyte releases 2000–3000 platelets during its lifespan. Following platelet\\nrelease, megakaryocyte remnants, which are little more than a cell nucleus, are consumed by macrophages.\\nPlatelets are relatively small, 2–4 µm in diameter, but numerous, with typically 150,000–160,000 per µL of blood.\\nAfter entering the circulation, approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response\\nto any rupture in a blood vessel. They then become activated to perform their primary function, which is to limit\\nblood loss. Platelets remain only about 10 days, then are phagocytized by macrophages.\\nPlatelets are critical to hemostasis, the stoppage of blood flow following damage to a vessel. They also secrete a\\nvariety of growth factors essential for growth and repair of tissue, particularly connective tissue. Infusions of\\nconcentrated platelets are now being used in some therapies to stimulate healing.\\nDisorders of Platelets\\nThrombocytosis is a condition in which there are too many platelets. This may trigger formation of unwanted blood\\nclots (thrombosis), a potentially fatal disorder. If there is an insufficient number of platelets, called\\nthrombocytopenia, blood may not clot properly, and excessive bleeding may result.\\n732 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Although rupture of larger vessels usually requires medical intervention, hemostasis is quite\\neffective in dealing with small, simple wounds. There are three steps to the process: vascular spasm, the formation\\nof a platelet plug, and coagulation (blood clotting). Failure of any of these steps will result in\\nhemorrhage—excessive bleeding.\\n18.5 • Hemostasis 733'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 749}, page_content='Vascular Spasm\\nWhen a vessel is severed or punctured, or when the wall of a vessel is damaged, vascular spasm occurs. In vascular\\nspasm, the smooth muscle in the walls of the vessel contracts dramatically. This smooth muscle has both circular\\nlayers; larger vessels also have longitudinal layers. The circular layers tend to constrict the flow of blood, whereas\\nthe longitudinal layers, when present, draw the vessel back into the surrounding tissue, often making it more\\ndifficult for a surgeon to locate, clamp, and tie off a severed vessel. The vascular spasm response is believed to be\\ntriggered by several chemicals called endothelins that are released by vessel-lining cells and by pain receptors in\\nresponse to vessel injury. This phenomenon typically lasts for up to 30 minutes, although it can last for hours.\\nFormation of the Platelet Plug\\nIn the second step, platelets, which normally float free in the plasma, encounter the area of vessel rupture with the\\nexposed underlying connective tissue and collagenous fibers. The platelets begin to clump together, become spiked\\nand sticky, and bind to the exposed collagen and endothelial lining. This process is assisted by a glycoprotein in the\\nblood plasma called von Willebrand factor, which helps stabilize the growing platelet plug. As platelets collect, they\\nsimultaneously release chemicals from their granules into the plasma that further contribute to hemostasis. Among\\nthe substances released by the platelets are:\\n• adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which helps additional platelets to adhere to the injury site, reinforcing and\\nexpanding the platelet plug\\n• serotonin, which maintains vasoconstriction\\n• prostaglandins and phospholipids, which also maintain vasoconstriction and help to activate further clotting\\nchemicals, as discussed next\\nA platelet plug can temporarily seal a small opening in a blood vessel. Plug formation, in essence, buys the body\\ntime while more sophisticated and durable repairs are being made. In a similar manner, even modern naval\\nwarships still carry an assortment of wooden plugs to temporarily repair small breaches in their hulls until\\npermanent repairs can be made.\\nCoagulation\\nThose more sophisticated and more durable repairs are collectively called coagulation, the formation of a blood\\nclot. The process is sometimes characterized as a cascade, because one event prompts the next as in a multi-level\\nwaterfall. The result is the production of a gelatinous but robust clot made up of a mesh of fibrin—an insoluble\\nfilamentous protein derived from fibrinogen, the plasma protein introduced earlier—in which platelets and blood\\ncells are trapped.

Upon contact with blood plasma, the\\ndamaged extravascular cells, which are extrinsic to the bloodstream, release factor III (thromboplastin).\\nSequentially, Ca2+ then factor VII (proconvertin), which is activated by factor III, are added, forming an enzyme\\ncomplex. This enzyme complex leads to activation of factor X (Stuart–Prower factor), which activates the common\\npathway discussed below. The events in the extrinsic pathway are completed in a matter of seconds.\\nIntrinsic Pathway\\nThe intrinsic pathway (also known as the contact activation pathway) is longer and more complex. In this case, the\\nfactors involved are intrinsic to (present within) the bloodstream. The pathway can be prompted by damage to the\\ntissues, resulting from internal factors such as arterial disease; however, it is most often initiated when factor XII\\n(Hageman factor) comes into contact with foreign materials, such as when a blood sample is put into a glass test\\ntube. Within the body, factor XII is typically activated when it encounters negatively charged molecules, such as\\ninorganic polymers and phosphate produced earlier in the series of intrinsic pathway reactions. Factor XII sets off a\\nseries of reactions that in turn activates factor XI (antihemolytic factor C or plasma thromboplastin antecedent) then\\nfactor IX (antihemolytic factor B or plasma thromboplasmin). In the meantime, chemicals released by the platelets\\nincrease the rate of these activation reactions. Finally, factor VIII (antihemolytic factor A) from the platelets and\\nendothelial cells combines with factor IX (antihemolytic factor B or plasma thromboplasmin) to form an enzyme\\ncomplex that activates factor X (Stuart–Prower factor or thrombokinase), leading to the common pathway. The\\nevents in the intrinsic pathway are completed in a few minutes.\\nCommon Pathway\\nBoth the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways lead to the common pathway, in which fibrin is produced to seal off the\\nvessel. Once factor X has been activated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway, the enzyme prothrombinase\\nconverts factor II, the inactive enzyme prothrombin, into the active enzyme thrombin. (Note that if the enzyme\\nthrombin were not normally in an inactive form, clots would form spontaneously, a condition not consistent with\\nlife.) Then, thrombin converts factor I, the soluble fibrinogen, into the insoluble fibrin protein strands. Factor XIII\\nthen stabilizes the fibrin clot.\\nFibrinolysis\\nThe stabilized clot is acted upon by contractile proteins within the platelets. As these proteins contract, they pull on\\nthe fibrin threads, bringing the edges of the clot more tightly together, somewhat as we do when tightening loose\\nshoelaces (see Figure 18.14a). This process also wrings out of the clot a small amount of fluid called serum, which\\nis blood plasma without its clotting factors.\\nTo restore normal blood flow as the vessel heals, the clot must eventually be removed. Fibrinolysis is the gradual\\ndegradation of the clot. Again, there is a fairly complicated series of reactions that involves factor XII and protein-\\ncatabolizing enzymes. During this process, the inactive protein plasminogen is converted into the active plasmin,\\nwhich gradually breaks down the fibrin of the clot. Additionally, bradykinin, a vasodilator, is released, reversing the\\neffects of the serotonin and prostaglandins from the platelets. This allows the smooth muscle in the walls of the\\nvessels to relax and helps to restore the circulation.\\n18.5 • Hemostasis 737'),\n",

How does the endothelium of the blood vessel walls prevent the blood from\\ncoagulating as it flows through the blood vessels?\\nDisorders of Clotting\\nEither an insufficient or an excessive production of platelets can lead to severe disease or death. As discussed\\nearlier, an insufficient number of platelets, called thrombocytopenia, typically results in the inability of blood to form\\nclots. This can lead to excessive bleeding, even from minor wounds.\\nAnother reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more\\nclotting factors. This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia, which is actually a group of related disorders,\\nthe most common of which is hemophilia A, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. This disorder results\\nin the inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII. Hemophilia B is the second most common form,\\naccounting for approximately 20 percent of cases. In this case, there is a deficiency of factor IX. Both of these\\ndefects are linked to the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy (carrier) female to their male\\noffspring, since males are XY. Females would need to inherit a defective gene from each parent to manifest the\\ndisease, since they are XX. Patients with hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds, and leak\\nblood into joint spaces after exercise and into urine and stool. Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an\\nautosomal (not sex) chromosome that renders factor XI nonfunctional. It is not a true recessive condition, since\\neven individuals with a single copy of the mutant gene show a tendency to bleed. Regular infusions of clotting\\nfactors isolated from healthy donors can help prevent bleeding in hemophiliac patients. At some point, genetic\\ntherapy will become a viable option.\\nIn contrast to the disorders characterized by coagulation failure is thrombocytosis, also mentioned earlier, a\\ncondition characterized by excessive numbers of platelets that increases the risk for excessive clot formation, a\\ncondition known as thrombosis. A thrombus (plural = thrombi) is an aggregation of platelets, erythrocytes, and\\neven WBCs typically trapped within a mass of fibrin strands. While the formation of a clot is normal following the\\nhemostatic mechanism just described, thrombi can form within an intact or only slightly damaged blood vessel. In a\\nlarge vessel, a thrombus will adhere to the vessel wall and decrease the flow of blood, and is referred to as a mural\\nthrombus. In a small vessel, it may actually totally block the flow of blood and is termed an occlusive thrombus.\\nThrombi are most commonly caused by vessel damage to the endothelial lining, which activates the clotting\\nmechanism. These may include venous stasis, when blood in the veins, particularly in the legs, remains stationary\\nfor long periods. This is one of the dangers of long airplane flights in crowded conditions and may lead to deep vein\\nthrombosis. Thrombophilia, also called hypercoagulation, is a condition in which there is a tendency to form\\nthrombosis. This may be familial (genetic) or acquired. Acquired forms include the autoimmune disease lupus,\\nimmune reactions to heparin, polycythemia vera, thrombocytosis, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, and even obesity. A\\nthrombus can seriously impede blood flow to or from a region and will cause a local increase in blood pressure. If\\nflow is to be maintained, the heart will need to generate a greater pressure to overcome the resistance.\\nWhen a portion of a thrombus breaks free from the vessel wall and enters the circulation, it is referred to as an\\n738 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

These are medical\\nemergencies.\\nAmong the many known biochemical activities of aspirin is its role as an anticoagulant.

Until that point, physicians did not understand that death\\nsometimes followed blood transfusions, when the type of donor blood infused into the patient was incompatible\\nwith the patient’s own blood. Blood groups are determined by the presence or absence of specific marker molecules\\non the plasma membranes of erythrocytes. With their discovery, it became possible for the first time to match\\npatient-donor blood types and prevent transfusion reactions and deaths.\\nAntigens, Antibodies, and Transfusion Reactions\\nAntigens are substances that the body does not recognize as belonging to the “self” and that therefore trigger a\\ndefensive response from the leukocytes of the immune system.

ABO blood types are genetically determined.\\nThe body must be exposed to a foreign antigen before an antibody can be produced. ABO blood group antigens are\\nfound in foods and microbes throughout nature. Thus, the human immune system is exposed to A and B antigens at\\nan early age and antibodies are formed naturally. Individuals with type A blood—without any prior exposure to\\nincompatible blood—have naturally-formed antibodies to the B antigen circulating in their blood plasma. These\\nantibodies, referred to as anti-B antibodies, will cause agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter\\nerythrocytes with B antigens. Similarly, an individual with type B blood has naturally-formed anti-A antibodies.\\nIndividuals with type AB blood, which has both antigens, do not have naturally-formed antibodies to either of these.\\nPeople with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes, but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies circulate\\nin their blood plasma.\\nRh Blood Groups\\nThe Rh blood group is classified according to the presence or absence of a second erythrocyte antigen identified as\\nRh. (It was first discovered in a type of primate known as a rhesus macaque, which is often used in research,\\nbecause its blood is similar to that of humans.) Although dozens of Rh antigens have been identified, only one,\\ndesignated D, is clinically important. Those who have the Rh D antigen present on their erythrocytes—about 85\\npercent of Americans—are described as Rh positive (Rh+) and those who lack it are Rh negative (Rh−). Note that the\\nRh group is distinct from the ABO group, so any individual, no matter their ABO blood type, may have or lack this Rh\\nantigen. When identifying a patient’s blood type, the Rh group is designated by adding the word positive or negative\\nto the ABO type. For example, A positive (A+) means ABO group A blood with the Rh antigen present, and AB\\nnegative (AB−) means ABO group AB blood without the Rh antigen.\\nTable 18.2 summarizes the distribution of the ABO and Rh blood types within the United States.\\nSummary of ABO and Rh Blood Types within the United States\\nBlood Type Asian Black non-Hispanic Hispanic North American Indian White non-Hispanic\\nA+ 27.3 24.0 28.7 31.3 33.0\\nA− 0.5 1.9 2.4 3.8 6.8\\nB+ 25.0 18.4 9.2 7.0 9.1\\nB− 0.4 1.3 0.7 0.9 1.8\\nAB+ 7.0 4.0 2.3 2.2 3.4\\nAB− 0.1 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.7\\nTABLE 18.2\\n740 18 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This process, called sensitization, occurs following a transfusion with Rh-\\nincompatible blood or, more commonly, with the birth of an Rh+ baby to an Rh− person. Problems are rare in a first\\npregnancy, since the baby’s Rh+ cells rarely cross the placenta (the organ of gas and nutrient exchange between the\\nfetus and the pregnant person). However, during or immediately after birth, the Rh− parent can be exposed to the\\nbaby’s Rh+ cells (Figure 18.15). Research has shown that this occurs in about 13−14 percent of such pregnancies.\\nAfter exposure, the immune system of the person who has given birth begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies. If the\\nsame person should then become pregnant with another Rh+ baby, the Rh antibodies they have produced can cross\\nthe placenta into the fetal bloodstream and destroy the fetal RBCs. This condition, known as hemolytic disease of\\nthe newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis fetalis, may cause anemia in mild cases, but the agglutination and\\nhemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in the womb or shortly after birth.\\nFIGURE 18.15 Erythroblastosis Fetalis The first exposure of an Rh− person to Rh+ erythrocytes during pregnancy induces\\n18.6 • Blood Typing 741'),\n",

Anti-Rh antibodies begin to circulate in the pregnant person's bloodstream. A second exposure occurs with a subsequent\\npregnancy with an Rh+ fetus in the uterus. During that subsequent pregnancy, the pregnant person's anti-Rh antibodies may cross the\\nplacenta and enter the fetal bloodstream, causing agglutination and hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes.\\nA drug known as RhoGAM, short for Rh immune globulin, can temporarily prevent the development of Rh antibodies\\nin the Rh− parent, thereby averting this potentially serious disease for the fetus. RhoGAM antibodies destroy any\\nfetal Rh+ erythrocytes that may cross the placental barrier. RhoGAM is normally administered to Rh− pregnant\\npeople during weeks 26−28 of pregnancy and within 72 hours following birth. It has proven remarkably effective in\\ndecreasing the incidence of HDN. Earlier we noted that the incidence of HDN in an Rh+ subsequent pregnancy to an\\nRh− person is about 13–14 percent without preventive treatment. Since the introduction of RhoGAM in 1968, the\\nincidence has dropped to about 0.1 percent in the United States.\\nDetermining ABO Blood Types\\nClinicians are able to determine a patient’s blood type quickly and easily using commercially prepared antibodies.\\nAn unknown blood sample is allocated into separate wells. Into one well a small amount of anti-A antibody is\\nadded, and to another a small amount of anti-B antibody. If the antigen is present, the antibodies will cause visible\\nagglutination of the cells (Figure 18.16). The blood should also be tested for Rh antibodies.\\nFIGURE 18.16 Cross Matching Blood Types This sample of a commercially produced “bedside” card enables quick typing of both a\\nrecipient’s and donor’s blood before transfusion. The card contains three reaction sites or wells. One is coated with an anti-A antibody, one\\nwith an anti-B antibody, and one with an anti-D antibody (tests for the presence of Rh factor D). Mixing a drop of blood and saline into each\\nwell enables the blood to interact with a preparation of type-specific antibodies, also called anti-seras. Agglutination of RBCs in a given site\\nindicates a positive identification of the blood antigens, in this case A and Rh antigens for blood type A+. For the purpose of transfusion, the\\ndonor’s and recipient’s blood types must match.\\nABO Transfusion Protocols\\nTo avoid transfusion reactions, it is best to transfuse only matching blood types; that is, a type B+ recipient should\\nideally receive blood only from a type B+ donor and so on. That said, in emergency situations, when acute\\nhemorrhage threatens the patient’s life, there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood type. In these\\ncases, blood from a universal donor—an individual with type O− blood—may be transfused. Recall that type O\\nerythrocytes do not display A or B antigens. Thus, anti-A or anti-B antibodies that might be circulating in the\\npatient’s blood plasma will not encounter any erythrocyte surface antigens on the donated blood and therefore will\\nnot be provoked into a response. One problem with this designation of universal donor is if the O− individual had\\nprior exposure to Rh antigen, Rh antibodies may be present in the donated blood. Also, introducing type O blood into\\nan individual with type A, B, or AB blood will nevertheless introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens, as\\nthese are always circulating in the type O blood plasma. This may cause problems for the recipient, but because the\\nvolume of blood transfused is much lower than the volume of the patient’s own blood, the adverse effects of the\\nrelatively few infused plasma antibodies are typically limited. Rh factor also plays a role. If Rh− individuals receiving\\nblood have had prior exposure to Rh antigen, antibodies for this antigen may be present in the blood and trigger\\nagglutination to some degree. Although it is always preferable to cross match a patient’s blood before transfusing, in\\na true life-threatening emergency situation, this is not always possible, and these procedures may be implemented.\\nA patient with blood type AB+ is known as the universal recipient. This patient can theoretically receive any type of\\nblood, because the patient’s own blood—having both A and B antigens on the erythrocyte surface—does not\\nproduce anti-A or anti-B antibodies. In addition, an Rh+ patient can receive both Rh+ and Rh− blood. However, keep\\nin mind that the donor’s blood will contain circulating antibodies, again with possible negative implications.

Blood is composed of formed\\nelements—erythrocytes, leukocytes, and cell fragments\\ncalled platelets—and a fluid extracellular matrix called\\nplasma. More than 90 percent of plasma is water. The\\nremainder is mostly plasma proteins—mainly albumin,\\nglobulins, and fibrinogen—and other dissolved solutes\\nsuch as glucose, lipids, electrolytes, and dissolved\\ngases. Because of the formed elements and the\\nplasma proteins and other solutes, blood is sticky and\\nmore viscous than water. It is also slightly alkaline, and\\nits temperature is slightly higher than normal body\\ntemperature.\\n18.2 Production of the Formed Elements\\nThrough the process of hemopoiesis, the formed\\nelements of blood are continually produced, replacing\\nthe relatively short-lived erythrocytes, leukocytes, and\\nplatelets. Hemopoiesis begins in the red bone marrow,\\nwith hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into\\nmyeloid and lymphoid lineages. Myeloid stem cells give\\nrise to most of the formed elements.

The\\nhemoglobin molecule contains four globin proteins\\nbound to a pigment molecule called heme, which\\ncontains an ion of iron. In the bloodstream, iron picks\\nup oxygen in the lungs and drops it off in the tissues;\\nthe amino acids in hemoglobin then transport carbon\\ndioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.\\nErythrocytes live only 120 days on average, and thus\\nmust be continually replaced.

Anemia\\nis a deficiency of RBCs or hemoglobin, whereas\\npolycythemia is an excess of RBCs.\\n18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets\\nLeukocytes function in body defenses. They squeeze\\nout of the walls of blood vessels through emigration or\\ndiapedesis, then may move through tissue fluid or\\nbecome attached to various organs where they fight\\nagainst pathogenic organisms, diseased cells, or other\\nthreats to health. Granular leukocytes, which include\\nneutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, originate with\\nmyeloid stem cells, as do the agranular monocytes.\\nThe other agranular leukocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T\\ncells, arise from the lymphoid stem cell line. The most\\nabundant leukocytes are the neutrophils, which are\\nfirst responders to infections, especially with bacteria.\\nAbout 20–30 percent of all leukocytes are\\nlymphocytes, which are critical to the body’s defense\\nagainst specific threats. Leukemia and lymphoma are\\nmalignancies involving leukocytes. Platelets are\\nfragments of cells known as megakaryocytes that dwell\\nwithin the bone marrow. While many platelets are\\nstored in the spleen, others enter the circulation and\\nare essential for hemostasis; they also produce several\\ngrowth factors important for repair and healing.\\n18.5 Hemostasis\\nHemostasis is the physiological process by which\\nbleeding ceases. Hemostasis involves three basic\\nsteps: vascular spasm, the formation of a platelet plug,\\nand coagulation, in which clotting factors promote the\\nformation of a fibrin clot. Fibrinolysis is the process in\\nwhich a clot is degraded in a healing vessel.\\nAnticoagulants are substances that oppose\\ncoagulation. They are important in limiting the extent\\nand duration of clotting. Inadequate clotting can result\\nfrom too few platelets, or inadequate production of\\nclotting factors, for instance, in the genetic disorder\\nhemophilia. Excessive clotting, called thrombosis, can\\nbe caused by excessive numbers of platelets. A\\nthrombus is a collection of fibrin, platelets, and\\nerythrocytes that has accumulated along the lining of a\\nblood vessel, whereas an embolus is a thrombus that\\nhas broken free from the vessel wall and is circulating\\nin the bloodstream.\\n18.6 Blood Typing\\nAntigens are nonself molecules, usually large proteins,\\nwhich provoke an immune response. In transfusion\\nreactions, antibodies attach to antigens on the surfaces\\nof erythrocytes and cause agglutination and hemolysis.\\nABO blood group antigens are designated A and B.\\nPeople with type A blood have A antigens on their\\nerythrocytes, whereas those with type B blood have B\\nantigens. Those with AB blood have both A and B\\nantigens, and those with type O blood have neither A\\nnor B antigens. The blood plasma contains preformed\\nantibodies against the antigens not present on a\\nperson’s erythrocytes.\\nA second group of blood antigens is the Rh group, the\\nmost important of which is Rh D. People with Rh− blood\\ndo not have this antigen on their erythrocytes, whereas\\nthose who are Rh+ do. About 85 percent of Americans\\nare Rh+. When a person who is Rh− becomes pregnant\\nwith an Rh+ fetus, their body may begin to produce\\nanti-Rh antibodies. If the person subsequently\\nbecomes pregnant with a second Rh+ fetus and is not\\ntreated preventively with RhoGAM, the fetus will be at\\nrisk for an antigen-antibody reaction, including\\nagglutination and hemolysis. This is known as\\nhemolytic disease of the newborn.\\nCross matching to determine blood type is necessary\\nbefore transfusing blood, unless the patient is\\nexperiencing hemorrhage that is an immediate threat\\nto life, in which case type O− blood may be transfused.\\n18 • Chapter Review 747'),\n",

If one assumes an average rate of contraction of 75 contractions per\\nminute, a human heart would contract approximately 108,000 times in one day, more than 39 million times in one\\nyear, and nearly 3 billion times during a 75-year lifespan. Each of the major pumping chambers of the heart ejects\\napproximately 70 mL blood per contraction in a resting adult. This would be equal to 5.25 liters of fluid per minute\\nand approximately 14,000 liters per day. Over one year, that would equal 10,000,000 liters or 2.6 million gallons of\\nblood sent through roughly 60,000 miles of vessels. In order to understand how that happens, it is necessary to\\nunderstand the anatomy and physiology of the heart.\\nLocation of the Heart\\nThe human heart is located within the thoracic cavity, medially between the lungs in the space known as the\\nmediastinum. Figure 19.2 shows the position of the heart within the thoracic cavity. Within the mediastinum, the\\nheart is separated from the other mediastinal structures by a tough membrane known as the pericardium, or\\npericardial sac, and sits in its own space called the pericardial cavity. The dorsal surface of the heart lies near the\\nbodies of the vertebrae, and its anterior surface sits deep to the sternum and costal cartilages. The great veins, the\\nsuperior and inferior venae cavae, and the great arteries, the aorta and pulmonary trunk, are attached to the\\nsuperior surface of the heart, called the base. The base of the heart is located at the level of the third costal\\ncartilage, as seen in Figure 19.2. The inferior tip of the heart, the apex, lies just to the left of the sternum between\\nthe junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages. The right side of the heart is\\ndeflected anteriorly, and the left side is deflected posteriorly. It is important to remember the position and\\norientation of the heart when placing a stethoscope on the chest of a patient and listening for heart sounds, and also\\nwhen looking at images taken from a midsagittal perspective. The slight deviation of the apex to the left is reflected\\nin a depression in the medial surface of the inferior lobe of the left lung, called the cardiac notch.\\n752 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

It is about the size of a fist, is broad at the top, and tapers toward the base.\\nEveryday Connection\\nCPR\\nThe position of the heart in the torso between the vertebrae and sternum (see Figure 19.2 for the position of the\\nheart within the thorax) allows for individuals to apply an emergency technique known as cardiopulmonary\\nresuscitation (CPR) if the heart of a patient should stop. By applying pressure with the flat portion of one hand on\\nthe sternum in the area between the line at T4 and T9 (Figure 19.3), it is possible to manually compress the\\nblood within the heart enough to push some of the blood within it into the pulmonary and systemic circuits. This\\nis particularly critical for the brain, as irreversible damage and death of neurons occur within minutes of loss of\\nblood flow. Current standards call for compression of the chest at least 5 cm deep and at a rate of 100\\ncompressions per minute, a rate equal to the beat in “Staying Alive,” recorded in 1977 by the Bee Gees. If you\\nare unfamiliar with this song, a version is available on www.youtube.com. At this stage, the emphasis is on\\nperforming high-quality chest compressions, rather than providing artificial respiration. CPR is generally\\nperformed until the patient regains spontaneous contraction or is declared dead by an experienced healthcare\\nprofessional.\\nWhen performed by untrained or overzealous individuals, CPR can result in broken ribs or a broken sternum, and\\ncan inflict additional severe damage on the patient. It is also possible, if the hands are placed too low on the\\nsternum, to manually drive the xiphoid process into the liver, a consequence that may prove fatal for the patient.\\nProper training is essential. This proven life-sustaining technique is so valuable that virtually all medical\\npersonnel as well as concerned members of the public should be certified and routinely recertified in its\\napplication. CPR courses are offered at a variety of locations, including colleges, hospitals, the American Red\\nCross, and some commercial companies.

There are also many other national and regional heart associations that offer the same service,\\ndepending upon the location.\\nShape and Size of the Heart\\nThe shape of the heart is similar to a pinecone, rather broad at the superior surface and tapering to the apex (see\\nFigure 19.2). A typical heart is approximately the size of your fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm\\n(2.5 in) in thickness. Given the size difference between most members of the sexes, the weight of a female heart is\\napproximately 250–300 grams (9 to 11 ounces), and the weight of a male heart is approximately 300–350 grams\\n(11 to 12 ounces). The heart of a well-trained athlete, especially one specializing in aerobic sports, can be\\nconsiderably larger than this. Cardiac muscle responds to exercise in a manner similar to that of skeletal muscle.\\nThat is, exercise results in the addition of protein myofilaments that increase the size of the individual cells without\\nincreasing their numbers, a concept called hypertrophy. Hearts of athletes can pump blood more effectively at lower\\nrates than those of nonathletes. Enlarged hearts are not always a result of exercise; they can result from\\npathologies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The cause of an abnormally enlarged heart muscle is unknown,\\nbut the condition is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in apparently otherwise healthy young people.\\nChambers and Circulation through the Heart\\nThe human heart consists of four chambers: The left side and the right side each have one atrium and one\\nventricle. Each of the upper chambers, the right atrium (plural = atria) and the left atrium, acts as a receiving\\nchamber and contracts to push blood into the lower chambers, the right ventricle and the left ventricle. The\\nventricles serve as the primary pumping chambers of the heart, propelling blood to the lungs or to the rest of the\\nbody.\\nThere are two distinct but linked circuits in the human circulation called the pulmonary and systemic circuits.\\nAlthough both circuits transport blood and everything it carries, we can initially view the circuits from the point of\\nview of gases. The pulmonary circuit transports blood to and from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and delivers\\ncarbon dioxide for exhalation. The systemic circuit transports oxygenated blood to virtually all of the tissues of the\\nbody and returns relatively deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide to the heart to be sent back to the pulmonary\\ncirculation.\\nmannequin.\\nFIGURE 19.3 CPR Technique If the heart should stop, CPR can maintain the flow of blood until the heart resumes beating.

These vessels in turn branch many times before reaching the\\npulmonary capillaries, where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters. The\\npulmonary trunk arteries and their branches are the only arteries in the post-natal body that carry relatively\\ndeoxygenated blood. Highly oxygenated blood returning from the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs passes through\\na series of vessels that join together to form the pulmonary veins—the only post-natal veins in the body that carry\\nhighly oxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins conduct blood into the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the\\nleft ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic\\ncircuit. Eventually, these vessels will lead to the systemic capillaries, where exchange with the tissue fluid and cells\\nof the body occurs. In this case, oxygen and nutrients exit the systemic capillaries to be used by the cells in their\\nmetabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products will enter the blood.\\nThe blood exiting the systemic capillaries is lower in oxygen concentration than when it entered. The capillaries will\\nultimately unite to form venules, joining to form ever-larger veins, eventually flowing into the two major systemic\\nveins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, which return blood to the right atrium.

Each of these components\\nplays its own unique role in terms of function.\\nMembranes\\nThe membrane that directly surrounds the heart and defines the pericardial cavity is called the pericardium or\\npericardial sac. It also surrounds the “roots” of the major vessels, or the areas of closest proximity to the heart. The\\npericardium, which literally translates as “around the heart,” consists of two distinct sublayers: the sturdy outer\\nfibrous pericardium and the inner serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is made of tough, dense connective\\ntissue that protects the heart and maintains its position in the thorax. The more delicate serous pericardium\\nconsists of two layers: the parietal pericardium, which is fused to the fibrous pericardium, and an inner visceral\\npericardium, or epicardium, which is fused to the heart and is part of the heart wall. The pericardial cavity, filled\\nwith lubricating serous fluid, lies between the epicardium and the pericardium.\\nIn most organs within the body, visceral serous membranes such as the epicardium are microscopic. However, in\\nthe case of the heart, it is not a microscopic layer but rather a macroscopic layer, consisting of a simple squamous\\nepithelium called a mesothelium, reinforced with loose, irregular, or areolar connective tissue that attaches to the\\npericardium. This mesothelium secretes the lubricating serous fluid that fills the pericardial cavity and reduces\\nfriction as the heart contracts. Figure 19.5 illustrates the pericardial membrane and the layers of the heart.\\nFIGURE 19.5 Pericardial Membranes and Layers of the Heart Wall The pericardial membrane that surrounds the heart consists of\\nthree layers and the pericardial cavity.

There is a\\nsuperficial leaf-like extension of the atria near the superior surface of the heart, one on each side, called an\\nauricle—a name that means “ear like”—because its shape resembles the external ear of a human (Figure 19.6).\\nAuricles are relatively thin-walled structures that can fill with blood and empty into the atria or upper chambers of\\nthe heart. You may also hear them referred to as atrial appendages. Also prominent is a series of fat-filled grooves,\\neach of which is known as a sulcus (plural = sulci), along the superior surfaces of the heart. Major coronary blood\\nvessels are located in these sulci. The deep coronary sulcus is located between the atria and ventricles.

Figure 19.6 illustrates anterior and posterior\\nviews of the surface of the heart.\\nwithin the pericardial cavity. In order to fill with blood for the next contraction, the heart must relax. However,\\nthe excess fluid in the pericardial cavity puts pressure on the heart and prevents full relaxation, so the chambers\\nwithin the heart contain slightly less blood as they begin each heart cycle. Over time, less and less blood is\\nejected from the heart. If the fluid builds up slowly, as in hypothyroidism, the pericardial cavity may be able to\\nexpand gradually to accommodate this extra volume. Some cases of fluid in excess of one liter within the\\npericardial cavity have been reported. Rapid accumulation of as little as 100 mL of fluid following trauma may\\ntrigger cardiac tamponade. Other common causes include myocardial rupture, pericarditis, cancer, or even\\ncardiac surgery. Removal of this excess fluid requires insertion of drainage tubes into the pericardial cavity.\\nPremature removal of these drainage tubes, for example, following cardiac surgery, or clot formation within\\nthese tubes are causes of this condition. Untreated, cardiac tamponade can lead to death.\\n19.1 • Heart Anatomy 757'),\n",

In order to develop a more precise\\nunderstanding of cardiac function, it is first necessary to explore the internal anatomical structures in more detail.\\nSepta of the Heart\\nThe word septum is derived from the Latin for “something that encloses;” in this case, a septum (plural = septa)\\nrefers to a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers. The septa are physical extensions of the\\nmyocardium lined with endocardium. Located between the two atria is the interatrial septum. Normally in an adult\\nheart, the interatrial septum bears an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, a remnant of an opening in\\nthe fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass directly from\\nthe right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the pulmonary circuit. Within seconds after birth, a\\nflap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and\\nestablishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern.\\nBetween the two ventricles is a second septum known as the interventricular septum. Unlike the interatrial\\nseptum, the interventricular septum is normally intact after its formation during fetal development. It is\\nsubstantially thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles generate far greater pressure when they\\ncontract.\\nThe septum between the atria and ventricles is known as the atrioventricular septum. It is marked by the presence\\nof four openings that allow blood to move from the atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles into the\\npulmonary trunk and aorta. Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles is a valve, a\\nspecialized structure that ensures one-way flow of blood. The valves between the atria and ventricles are known\\ngenerically as atrioventricular valves. The valves at the openings that lead to the pulmonary trunk and aorta are\\nknown generically as semilunar valves. The interventricular septum is visible in Figure 19.9. In this figure, the\\natrioventricular septum has been removed to better show the bicuspid and tricuspid valves; the interatrial septum is\\nnot visible, since its location is covered by the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Since these openings and valves\\nstructurally weaken the atrioventricular septum, the remaining tissue is heavily reinforced with dense connective\\ntissue called the cardiac skeleton, or skeleton of the heart. It includes four rings that surround the openings\\nbetween the atria and ventricles, and the openings to the pulmonary trunk and aorta, and serve as the point of\\nattachment for the heart valves. The cardiac skeleton also provides an important boundary in the heart electrical\\nconduction system.\\n760 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In nonlife-threatening cases, it is better to\\nmonitor the condition than to risk heart surgery to repair and seal the opening.\\nCoarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormal narrowing of the aorta that is normally located at the insertion\\nof the ligamentum arteriosum, the remnant of the fetal shunt called the ductus arteriosus. If severe, this\\ncondition drastically restricts blood flow through the primary systemic artery, which is life threatening. In some\\nindividuals, the condition may be fairly benign and not detected until later in life. Detectable symptoms in an\\ninfant include difficulty breathing, poor appetite, trouble feeding, or failure to thrive. In older individuals,\\nsymptoms include dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, headache, and nosebleeds.\\nTreatment involves surgery to resect (remove) the affected region or angioplasty to open the abnormally narrow\\npassageway. Studies have shown that the earlier the surgery is performed, the better the chance of survival.\\nA patent ductus arteriosus is a congenital condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close. The condition\\nmay range from severe to benign. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close results in blood flowing from the\\nhigher pressure aorta into the lower pressure pulmonary trunk. This additional fluid moving toward the lungs\\nincreases pulmonary pressure and makes respiration difficult. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea),\\ntachycardia, enlarged heart, a widened pulse pressure, and poor weight gain in infants. Treatments include\\nsurgical closure (ligation), manual closure using platinum coils or specialized mesh inserted via the femoral\\nartery or vein, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to block the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which\\nmaintains the vessel in an open position. If untreated, the condition can result in congestive heart failure.\\n19.1 • Heart Anatomy 761'),\n",

The\\nSeptal defects are not uncommon in individuals and may be congenital or caused by various disease processes.\\nTetralogy of Fallot is a congenital condition that may also occur from exposure to unknown environmental\\nfactors; it occurs when there is an opening in the interventricular septum caused by blockage of the pulmonary\\ntrunk, normally at the pulmonary semilunar valve. This allows blood that is relatively low in oxygen from the right\\nventricle to flow into the left ventricle and mix with the blood that is relatively high in oxygen. Symptoms include\\na distinct heart murmur, low blood oxygen percent saturation, dyspnea or difficulty in breathing, polycythemia,\\nbroadening (clubbing) of the fingers and toes, and in children, difficulty in feeding or failure to grow and develop.\\nIt is the most common cause of cyanosis following birth. The term “tetralogy” is derived from the four\\ncomponents of the condition, although only three may be present in an individual patient: pulmonary\\ninfundibular stenosis (rigidity of the pulmonary valve), overriding aorta (the aorta is shifted above both\\nventricles), ventricular septal defect (opening), and right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of the right\\nventricle). Other heart defects may also accompany this condition, which is typically confirmed by\\nechocardiography imaging. Tetralogy of Fallot occurs in approximately 400 out of one million live births. Normal\\ntreatment involves extensive surgical repair, including the use of stents to redirect blood flow and replacement\\nof valves and patches to repair the septal defect, but the condition has a relatively high mortality.

Most blood flows passively into\\nthe heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the\\nleft atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. This atrial contraction accounts for approximately 20\\npercent of ventricular filling. The opening between the left atrium and ventricle is guarded by the mitral valve.\\nLeft Ventricle\\nRecall that, although both sides of the heart will pump the same amount of blood, the muscular layer is much\\nthicker in the left ventricle compared to the right (see Figure 19.8).

Following this 10-year period of medical training and clinical\\nexperience, they qualify for a rigorous two-day examination administered by the Board of Internal Medicine that\\ntests their academic training and clinical abilities, including diagnostics and treatment. After successful completion\\nDisorders of the...\\nHeart Valves\\nWhen heart valves do not function properly, they are often described as incompetent and result in valvular heart\\ndisease, which can range from benign to lethal. Some of these conditions are congenital, that is, the individual\\nwas born with the defect, whereas others may be attributed to disease processes or trauma. Some malfunctions\\nare treated with medications, others require surgery, and still others may be mild enough that the condition is\\nmerely monitored since treatment might trigger more serious consequences.\\nValvular disorders are often caused by carditis, or inflammation of the heart. One common trigger for this\\ninflammation is rheumatic fever, or scarlet fever, an autoimmune response to the presence of a bacterium,\\nStreptococcus pyogenes, normally a disease of childhood.\\nWhile any of the heart valves may be involved in valve disorders, mitral regurgitation is the most common,\\ndetected in approximately 2 percent of the population, and the pulmonary semilunar valve is the least frequently\\ninvolved. When a valve malfunctions, the flow of blood to a region will often be disrupted. The resulting\\ninadequate flow of blood to this region will be described in general terms as an insufficiency. The specific type of\\ninsufficiency is named for the valve involved: aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, tricuspid insufficiency, or\\npulmonary insufficiency.\\nIf one of the cusps of the valve is forced backward by the force of the blood, the condition is referred to as a\\nprolapsed valve. Prolapse may occur if the chordae tendineae are damaged or broken, causing the closure\\nmechanism to fail. The failure of the valve to close properly disrupts the normal one-way flow of blood and\\nresults in regurgitation, when the blood flows backward from its normal path. Using a stethoscope, the\\ndisruption to the normal flow of blood produces a heart murmur.\\nStenosis is a condition in which the heart valves become rigid and may calcify over time. The loss of flexibility of\\nthe valve interferes with normal function and may cause the heart to work harder to propel blood through the\\nvalve, which eventually weakens the heart. Aortic stenosis affects approximately 2 percent of the population\\nover 65 years of age, and the percentage increases to approximately 4 percent in individuals over 85 years.\\nOccasionally, one or more of the chordae tendineae will tear or the papillary muscle itself may die as a\\ncomponent of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). In this case, the patient’s condition will deteriorate\\ndramatically and rapidly, and immediate surgical intervention may be required.\\nAuscultation, or listening to a patient’s heart sounds, is one of the most useful diagnostic tools, since it is\\nproven, safe, and inexpensive. The term auscultation is derived from the Latin for “to listen,” and the technique\\nhas been used for diagnostic purposes as far back as the ancient Egyptians. Valve and septal disorders will\\ntrigger abnormal heart sounds. If a valvular disorder is detected or suspected, a test called an echocardiogram,\\nor simply an “echo,” may be ordered.

Like all other cells, a cardiomyocyte requires a reliable supply of oxygen and nutrients, and a\\nway to remove wastes, so it needs a dedicated, complex, and extensive coronary circulation. And because of the\\ncritical and nearly ceaseless activity of the heart throughout life, this need for a blood supply is even greater than for\\na typical cell. However, coronary circulation is not continuous; rather, it cycles, reaching a peak when the heart\\nmuscle is relaxed and nearly ceasing while it is contracting.\\nCoronary Arteries\\nCoronary arteries supply blood to the myocardium and other components of the heart. The first portion of the aorta\\nafter it arises from the left ventricle gives rise to the coronary arteries. There are three dilations in the wall of the\\naorta just superior to the aortic semilunar valve. Two of these, the left posterior aortic sinus and anterior aortic\\nsinus, give rise to the left and right coronary arteries, respectively. The third sinus, the right posterior aortic sinus,\\ntypically does not give rise to a vessel. Coronary vessel branches that remain on the surface of the artery and follow\\nthe sulci are called epicardial coronary arteries.\\nThe left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the\\ninterventricular septum. The circumflex artery arises from the left coronary artery and follows the coronary sulcus\\nto the left. Eventually, it will fuse with the small branches of the right coronary artery. The larger anterior\\ninterventricular artery, also known as the left anterior descending artery (LAD), is the second major branch arising\\nfrom the left coronary artery. It follows the anterior interventricular sulcus around the pulmonary trunk. Along the\\nway it gives rise to numerous smaller branches that interconnect with the branches of the posterior interventricular\\nartery, forming anastomoses. An anastomosis is an area where vessels unite to form interconnections that normally\\nallow blood to circulate to a region even if there may be partial blockage in another branch.

Longer-term treatments include injections of thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase that dissolve\\nthe clot, the anticoagulant heparin, balloon angioplasty and stents to open blocked vessels, and bypass surgery\\nto allow blood to pass around the site of blockage.

Not the least of these exceptional properties is its ability to initiate an electrical\\npotential at a fixed rate that spreads rapidly from cell to cell to trigger the contractile mechanism. This property is\\nknown as autorhythmicity. Neither smooth nor skeletal muscle can do this. Even though cardiac muscle has\\nautorhythmicity, heart rate is modulated by the endocrine and nervous systems.\\nThere are two major types of cardiac muscle cells: myocardial contractile cells and myocardial conducting cells. The\\nmyocardial contractile cells constitute the bulk (99 percent) of the cells in the atria and ventricles. Contractile cells\\nconduct impulses and are responsible for contractions that pump blood through the body. The myocardial\\nconducting cells (1 percent of the cells) form the conduction system of the heart. Except for Purkinje cells, they are\\ngenerally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few of the myofibrils or filaments needed for contraction.\\nTheir function is similar in many respects to neurons, although they are specialized muscle cells. Myocardial\\nconduction cells initiate and propagate the action potential (the electrical impulse) that travels throughout the heart\\nand triggers the contractions that propel the blood.\\nStructure of Cardiac Muscle\\nCompared to the giant cylinders of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, are considerably\\nshorter with much smaller diameters. Cardiac muscle also demonstrates striations, the alternating pattern of dark A\\nbands and light I bands attributed to the precise arrangement of the myofilaments and fibrils that are organized in\\nsarcomeres along the length of the cell (Figure 19.17a). These contractile elements are virtually identical to skeletal\\nmuscle. T (transverse) tubules penetrate from the surface plasma membrane, the sarcolemma, to the interior of the\\ncell, allowing the electrical impulse to reach the interior. The T tubules are only found at the Z discs, whereas in\\nskeletal muscle, they are found at the junction of the A and I bands. Therefore, there are one-half as many T tubules\\nin cardiac muscle as in skeletal muscle. In addition, the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores few calcium ions, so most of\\nthe calcium ions must come from outside the cells. The result is a slower onset of contraction. Mitochondria are\\nplentiful, providing energy for the contractions of the heart. Typically, cardiomyocytes have a single, central nucleus,\\nbut two or more nuclei may be found in some cells.\\nCardiac muscle cells branch freely. A junction between two adjoining cells is marked by a critical structure called an\\nintercalated disc, which helps support the synchronized contraction of the muscle (Figure 19.17b). The\\nsarcolemmas from adjacent cells bind together at the intercalated discs. They consist of desmosomes, specialized\\nlinking proteoglycans, tight junctions, and large numbers of gap junctions that allow the passage of ions between the\\ncells and help to synchronize the contraction (Figure 19.17c). Intercellular connective tissue also helps to bind the\\ncells together. The importance of strongly binding these cells together is necessitated by the forces exerted by\\ncontraction.\\nCoronary bypass surgery may also be performed. This surgical procedure grafts a replacement vessel obtained\\nfrom another, less vital portion of the body to bypass the occluded area. This procedure is clearly effective in\\ntreating patients experiencing a MI, but overall does not increase longevity. Nor does it seem advisable in\\npatients with stable although diminished cardiac capacity since frequently loss of mental acuity occurs following\\nthe procedure. Long-term changes to behavior, emphasizing diet and exercise plus a medicine regime tailored to\\nlower blood pressure, lower cholesterol and lipids, and reduce clotting are equally as effective.\\n772 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

When two independently beating embryonic cardiac muscle cells are\\nplaced together, the cell with the higher inherent rate sets the pace, and the impulse spreads from the faster to the\\nslower cell to trigger a contraction. As more cells are joined together, the fastest cell continues to assume control of\\nthe rate. A fully developed adult heart maintains the capability of generating its own electrical impulse, triggered by\\nthe fastest cells, as part of the cardiac conduction system. The components of the cardiac conduction system\\ninclude the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, the atrioventricular bundle, the atrioventricular bundle\\nbranches, and the Purkinje cells (Figure 19.18).\\nFIGURE 19.18 Conduction System of the Heart Specialized conducting components of the heart include the sinoatrial node, the\\ninternodal pathways, the atrioventricular node, the atrioventricular bundle, the right and left bundle branches, and the Purkinje fibers.\\nSinoatrial (SA) Node\\nNormal cardiac rhythm is established by the sinoatrial (SA) node, a specialized clump of myocardial conducting\\ncells located in the superior and posterior walls of the right atrium in close proximity to the orifice of the superior\\nvena cava. The SA node has the highest inherent rate of depolarization and is known as the pacemaker of the heart.\\nIt initiates the sinus rhythm, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart.\\nThis impulse spreads from its initiation in the SA node throughout the atria through specialized internodal\\npathways, to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node. The internodal pathways consist\\nof three bands (anterior, middle, and posterior) that lead directly from the SA node to the next node in the\\nconduction system, the atrioventricular node (see Figure 19.18). The impulse takes approximately 50 ms\\n(milliseconds) to travel between these two nodes. The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since\\nthe impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply following the cell-by-cell pathway through the contractile\\ncells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there is a specialized pathway called Bachmann’s bundle or the\\ninteratrial band that conducts the impulse directly from the right atrium to the left atrium. Regardless of the\\npathway, as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum, the connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents\\nthe impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the atrioventricular node. Figure\\n19.19 illustrates the initiation of the impulse in the SA node that then spreads the impulse throughout the atria to\\nwill be greatly enhanced. To date, myocardial cells produced within the patient (in situ) by cardiac stem cells\\nseem to be nonfunctional, although those grown in Petri dishes (in vitro) do beat.

(2) The SA\\nnode initiates the action potential, which sweeps across the atria. (3) After reaching the atrioventricular node, there is a delay of\\napproximately 100 ms that allows the atria to complete pumping blood before the impulse is transmitted to the atrioventricular bundle. (4)\\nFollowing the delay, the impulse travels through the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers, and also reaches\\nthe right papillary muscle via the moderator band. (5) The impulse spreads to the contractile fibers of the ventricle. (6) Ventricular\\ncontraction begins.\\nThe electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for muscular contraction. The wave of depolarization\\nbegins in the right atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through\\nthe contractile cells. The contractile cells then begin contraction from the superior to the inferior portions of the\\natria, efficiently pumping blood into the ventricles.\\nAtrioventricular (AV) Node\\nThe atrioventricular (AV) node is a second clump of specialized myocardial conductive cells, located in the inferior\\nportion of the right atrium within the atrioventricular septum. The septum prevents the impulse from spreading\\ndirectly to the ventricles without passing through the AV node. There is a critical pause before the AV node\\ndepolarizes and transmits the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle (see Figure 19.19, step 3). This delay in\\ntransmission is partially attributable to the small diameter of the cells of the node, which slow the impulse. Also,\\nconduction between nodal cells is less efficient than between conducting cells. These factors mean that it takes the\\nimpulse approximately 100 ms to pass through the node. This pause is critical to heart function, as it allows the\\natrial cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood into the ventricles before the impulse is\\ntransmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself. With extreme stimulation by the SA node, the AV node can transmit\\nimpulses maximally at 220 per minute. This establishes the typical maximum heart rate in a healthy young\\nindividual. Damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these rates, the heart\\ncan no longer effectively pump blood.\\nAtrioventricular Bundle (Bundle of His), Bundle Branches, and Purkinje Fibers\\nArising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular\\nseptum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, commonly called the left and right bundle\\nbranches. The left bundle branch has two fascicles. The left bundle branch supplies the left ventricle, and the right\\nbundle branch the right ventricle.

Portions of the right bundle branch are found in the moderator band and supply\\nthe right papillary muscles. Because of this connection, each papillary muscle receives the impulse at approximately\\nthe same time, so they begin to contract simultaneously just prior to the remainder of the myocardial contractile\\ncells of the ventricles. This is believed to allow tension to develop on the chordae tendineae prior to right ventricular\\ncontraction. There is no corresponding moderator band on the left. Both bundle branches descend and reach the\\napex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see Figure 19.19, step 4). This passage takes\\napproximately 25 ms.\\nThe Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial\\ncontractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the\\natrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the\\nelectrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the\\nelectrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the\\nheart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the\\nventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The total time elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA\\nnode until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.\\nMembrane Potentials and Ion Movement in Cardiac Conductive Cells\\nAction potentials are considerably different between cardiac conductive cells and cardiac contractive cells. While\\nNa+ and K+ play essential roles, Ca2+ is also critical for both types of cells. Unlike skeletal muscles and neurons,\\ncardiac conductive cells do not have a stable resting potential. Conductive cells contain a series of sodium ion\\nchannels that allow a normal and slow influx of sodium ions that causes the membrane potential to rise slowly from\\nan initial value of −60 mV up to about –40 mV. The resulting movement of sodium ions creates spontaneous\\ndepolarization (or prepotential depolarization). At this point, calcium ion channels open and Ca2+ enters the cell,\\nfurther depolarizing it at a more rapid rate until it reaches a value of approximately +15 mV. At this point, the\\ncalcium ion channels close and K+ channels open, allowing outflux of K+ and resulting in repolarization. When the\\nmembrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the K+ channels close and Na+ channels open, and the\\nprepotential phase begins again. This phenomenon explains the autorhythmicity properties of cardiac muscle\\n(Figure 19.20).\\nFIGURE 19.20 Action Potential at the SA Node The prepotential is due to a slow influx of sodium ions until the threshold is reached\\nfollowed by a rapid depolarization and repolarization. The prepotential accounts for the membrane reaching threshold and initiates the\\nspontaneous depolarization and contraction of the cell. Note the lack of a resting potential.\\nMembrane Potentials and Ion Movement in Cardiac Contractile Cells\\nThere is a distinctly different electrical pattern involving the contractile cells. In this case, there is a rapid\\ndepolarization, followed by a plateau phase and then repolarization. This phenomenon accounts for the long\\nrefractory periods required for the cardiac muscle cells to pump blood effectively before they are capable of firing\\nfor a second time. These cardiac myocytes normally do not initiate their own electrical potential but rather wait for\\nan impulse to reach them.\\nContractile cells demonstrate a much more stable resting phase than conductive cells at approximately −80 mV for\\ncells in the atria and −90 mV for cells in the ventricles. Despite this initial difference, the other components of their\\naction potentials are virtually identical.

This rapid influx of positively\\ncharged ions raises the membrane potential to approximately +30 mV, at which point the sodium channels close.\\nThe rapid depolarization period typically lasts 3–5 ms. Depolarization is followed by the plateau phase, in which\\nmembrane potential declines relatively slowly. This is due in large part to the opening of the slow Ca2+ channels,\\nallowing Ca2+ to enter the cell while few K+ channels are open, allowing K+ to exit the cell. The relatively long\\nplateau phase lasts approximately 175 ms. Once the membrane potential reaches approximately zero, the Ca2+\\nchannels close and K+ channels open, allowing K+ to exit the cell. The repolarization lasts approximately 75 ms. At\\nthis point, membrane potential drops until it reaches resting levels once more and the cycle repeats. The entire\\nevent lasts between 250 and 300 ms (Figure 19.21).\\nThe absolute refractory period for cardiac contractile muscle lasts approximately 200 ms, and the relative refractory\\nperiod lasts approximately 50 ms, for a total of 250 ms. This extended period is critical, since the heart muscle must\\ncontract to pump blood effectively and the contraction must follow the electrical events. Without extended\\nrefractory periods, premature contractions would occur in the heart and would not be compatible with life.\\nFIGURE 19.21 Action Potential in Cardiac Contractile Cells (a) Note the long plateau phase due to the influx of calcium ions.

Since the SA node is the\\npacemaker, it reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system. It will initiate the\\nimpulses spreading to the other conducting cells. The SA node, without nervous or endocrine control, would initiate\\na heart impulse approximately 80–100 times per minute. Although each component of the conduction system is\\ncapable of generating its own impulse, the rate progressively slows as you proceed from the SA node to the Purkinje\\nfibers. Without the SA node, the AV node would generate a heart rate of 40–60 beats per minute. If the AV node\\nwere blocked, the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of approximately 30–40 impulses per minute. The\\nbundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20–30 impulses per minute, and the Purkinje fibers would fire at\\n15–20 impulses per minute. While a few exceptionally trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in\\nthe range of 30–40 beats per minute (the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per minute for Miguel Indurain, a\\ncyclist), for most individuals, rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition called bradycardia.\\nDepending upon the specific individual, as rates fall much below this level, the heart would be unable to maintain\\nadequate flow of blood to vital tissues, initially resulting in decreasing loss of function across the systems,\\nunconsciousness, and ultimately death.\\nElectrocardiogram\\nBy careful placement of surface electrodes on the body, it is possible to record the complex, compound electrical\\nsignal of the heart. This tracing of the electrical signal is the electrocardiogram (ECG), also commonly abbreviated\\nEKG (K coming kardiology, from the German term for cardiology). Careful analysis of the ECG reveals a detailed\\npicture of both normal and abnormal heart function, and is an indispensable clinical diagnostic tool. The standard\\nelectrocardiograph (the instrument that generates an ECG) uses 3, 5, or 12 leads. The greater the number of leads\\nan electrocardiograph uses, the more information the ECG provides. The term “lead” may be used to refer to the\\ncable from the electrode to the electrical recorder, but it typically describes the voltage difference between two of\\nthe electrodes. The 12-lead electrocardiograph uses 10 electrodes placed in standard locations on the patient’s\\nskin (Figure 19.22). In continuous ambulatory electrocardiographs, the patient wears a small, portable, battery-\\noperated device known as a Holter monitor, or simply a Holter, that continuously monitors heart electrical activity,\\ntypically for a period of 24 hours during the patient’s normal routine.\\n778 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Accordingly, when the heart chambers are\\nrelaxed (diastole), blood will flow into the atria from the veins, which are higher in pressure. As blood flows into the\\natria, the pressure will rise, so the blood will initially move passively from the atria into the ventricles. When the\\naction potential triggers the muscles in the atria to contract (atrial systole), the pressure within the atria rises\\nfurther, pumping blood into the ventricles. During ventricular systole, pressure rises in the ventricles, pumping blood\\ninto the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle and into the aorta from the left ventricle. Again, as you consider\\nthis flow and relate it to the conduction pathway, the elegance of the system should become apparent.\\n784 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Blood is flowing into the\\nright atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and the coronary sinus. Blood flows into the left atrium from\\nthe four pulmonary veins. The two atrioventricular valves, the tricuspid and mitral valves, are both open, so blood\\nflows unimpeded from the atria and into the ventricles. Approximately 70–80 percent of ventricular filling occurs by\\nthis method. The two semilunar valves, the pulmonary and aortic valves, are closed, preventing backflow of blood\\ninto the right and left ventricles from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left.\\nAtrial Systole and Diastole\\nContraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As the atrial muscles contract\\nfrom the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the atria and blood is\\npumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular (tricuspid, and mitral or bicuspid) valves. At the start of\\natrial systole, the ventricles are normally filled with approximately 70–80 percent of their capacity due to inflow\\nduring diastole. Atrial contraction, also referred to as the “atrial kick,” contributes the remaining 20–30 percent of\\nfilling (see Figure 19.27). Atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial\\nmuscle returns to diastole.\\nVentricular Systole\\nVentricular systole (see Figure 19.27) follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS\\ncomplex in the ECG. It may be conveniently divided into two phases, lasting a total of 270 ms. At the end of atrial\\nsystole and just prior to ventricular contraction, the ventricles contain approximately 130 mL blood in a resting adult\\nin a standing position. This volume is known as the end diastolic volume (EDV) or preload.\\nInitially, as the muscles in the ventricle contract, the pressure of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet\\nhigh enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. However, blood\\npressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. This increase in pressure causes\\nblood to flow back toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. Since blood is not being ejected from the\\nventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial\\nphase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction (see Figure\\n19.27).\\nIn the second phase of ventricular systole, the ventricular ejection phase, the contraction of the ventricular muscle\\nhas raised the pressure within the ventricle to the point that it is greater than the pressures in the pulmonary trunk\\nand the aorta. Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure\\ngenerated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle, since\\nthe existing pressure in the aorta will be so much higher. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of\\nblood. This quantity is referred to as stroke volume. Stroke volume will normally be in the range of 70–80 mL. Since\\nventricular systole began with an EDV of approximately 130 mL of blood, this means that there is still 50–60 mL of\\nblood remaining in the ventricle following contraction. This volume of blood is known as the end systolic volume\\n(ESV).\\nVentricular Diastole\\nVentricular relaxation, or diastole, follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the T wave of the\\nECG. It too is divided into two distinct phases and lasts approximately 430 ms.\\nDuring the early phase of ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the remaining blood\\nwithin the ventricle begins to fall. When pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both the pulmonary\\ntrunk and aorta, blood flows back toward the heart, producing the dicrotic notch (small dip) seen in blood pressure\\ntracings. The semilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the heart. Since the atrioventricular valves remain\\nclosed at this point, there is no change in the volume of blood in the ventricle, so the early phase of ventricular\\ndiastole is called the isovolumic ventricular relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation\\nphase (see Figure 19.27).\\nIn the second phase of ventricular diastole, called late ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes,\\npressure on the blood within the ventricles drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria.\\nWhen this occurs, blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves.

The cardiac cycle is complete.\\nFigure 19.28 illustrates the relationship between the cardiac cycle and the ECG.\\nFIGURE 19.28 Relationship between the Cardiac Cycle and ECG Initially, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). The P\\nwave represents depolarization of the atria and is followed by atrial contraction (systole). Atrial systole extends until the QRS complex, at\\nwhich point, the atria relax. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the ventricles and is followed by ventricular contraction. The T\\nwave represents the repolarization of the ventricles and marks the beginning of ventricular relaxation.\\nHeart Sounds\\nOne of the simplest, yet effective, diagnostic techniques applied to assess the state of a patient’s heart is\\nauscultation using a stethoscope.\\nIn a normal, healthy heart, there are only two audible heart sounds: S1 and S2. S1 is the sound created by the\\nclosing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as a “lub,” or first heart\\nsound. The second heart sound, S2, is the sound of the closing of the semilunar valves during ventricular diastole\\nand is described as a “dub” (Figure 19.29). In both cases, as the valves close, the openings within the\\natrioventricular septum guarded by the valves will become reduced, and blood flow through the opening will\\nbecome more turbulent until the valves are fully closed. There is a third heart sound, S3, but it is rarely heard in\\nhealthy individuals. It may be the sound of blood flowing into the atria, or blood sloshing back and forth in the\\nventricle, or even tensing of the chordae tendineae. S3 may be heard in youth, some athletes, and pregnant people.\\nIf the sound is heard later in life, it may indicate congestive heart failure, warranting further tests. Some\\ncardiologists refer to the collective S1, S2, and S3 sounds as the “Kentucky gallop,” because they mimic those\\nproduced by a galloping horse. The fourth heart sound, S4, results from the contraction of the atria pushing blood\\ninto a stiff or hypertrophic ventricle, indicating failure of the left ventricle. S4 occurs prior to S1 and the collective\\nsounds S4, S1, and S2 are referred to by some cardiologists as the “Tennessee gallop,” because of their similarity to\\nthe sound produced by a galloping horse with a different gait. A few individuals may have both S3 and S4, and this\\ncombined sound is referred to as S7.\\n786 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Neural and endocrine controls are vital to the regulation of\\ncardiac function. In addition, the heart is sensitive to several environmental factors, including electrolytes.\\nResting Cardiac Output\\nCardiac output (CO) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute. To calculate\\nthis value, multiply stroke volume (SV), the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle, by heart rate (HR), in\\ncontractions per minute (or beats per minute, bpm). It can be represented mathematically by the following\\nequation:\\nCO = HR × SV\\nSV is normally measured using an echocardiogram to record EDV and ESV, and calculating the difference: SV = EDV\\n– ESV. SV can also be measured using a specialized catheter, but this is an invasive procedure and far more\\ndangerous to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There\\nare several important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex,\\ncontractility, duration of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance.

Remember, however, that these\\nnumbers refer to CO from each ventricle separately, not the total for the heart. Factors influencing CO are\\nsummarized in Figure 19.31.\\nFIGURE 19.31 Major Factors Influencing Cardiac Output Cardiac output is influenced by heart rate and stroke volume, both of which\\nare also variable.\\nSVs are also used to calculate ejection fraction, which is the portion of the blood that is pumped or ejected from the\\nheart with each contraction. To calculate ejection fraction, SV is divided by EDV. Despite the name, the ejection\\nfraction is normally expressed as a percentage. Ejection fractions range from approximately 55–70 percent, with a\\nmean of 58 percent.\\nExercise and Maximum Cardiac Output\\nIn healthy young individuals, HR may increase to 150 bpm during exercise. SV can also increase from 70 to\\napproximately 130 mL due to increased strength of contraction. This would increase CO to approximately 19.5 L/\\nmin, 4–5 times the resting rate. Top cardiovascular athletes can achieve even higher levels. At their peak\\nperformance, they may increase resting CO by 7–8 times.\\nSince the heart is a muscle, exercising it increases its efficiency. The difference between maximum and resting CO is\\nknown as the cardiac reserve. It measures the residual capacity of the heart to pump blood.\\nHeart Rates\\nHRs vary considerably, not only with exercise and fitness levels, but also with age. Newborn resting HRs may be 120\\nbpm. HR gradually decreases until young adulthood and then gradually increases again with age.\\nMaximum HRs are normally in the range of 200–220 bpm, although there are some extreme cases in which they\\nmay reach higher levels. As one ages, the ability to generate maximum rates decreases. This may be estimated by\\ntaking the maximal value of 220 bpm and subtracting the individual’s age. So a 40-year-old individual would be\\nexpected to hit a maximum rate of approximately 180, and a 60-year-old person would achieve a HR of 160.\\nDisorders of the...\\nHeart: Abnormal Heart Rates\\nFor an adult, normal resting HR will be in the range of 60–100 bpm. Bradycardia is the condition in which resting\\nrate drops below 60 bpm, and tachycardia is the condition in which the resting rate is above 100 bpm. Trained\\nathletes typically have very low HRs. If the patient is not exhibiting other symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue,\\ndizziness, fainting, chest discomfort, palpitations, or respiratory distress, bradycardia is not considered clinically\\n19.4 • Cardiac Physiology 789'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 805}, page_content='Correlation Between Heart Rates and Cardiac Output\\nInitially, physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV. During exercise, the rate of\\nblood returning to the heart increases. However as the HR rises, there is less time spent in diastole and\\nconsequently less time for the ventricles to fill with blood. Even though there is less filling time, SV will initially\\nremain high. However, as HR continues to increase, SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time. CO will\\ninitially stabilize as the increasing HR compensates for the decreasing SV, but at very high rates, CO will eventually\\ndecrease as increasing rates are no longer able to compensate for the decreasing SV. Consider this phenomenon in\\na healthy young individual. Initially, as HR increases from resting to approximately 120 bpm, CO will rise. As HR\\nincreases from 120 to 160 bpm, CO remains stable, since the increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular\\nfilling time and, consequently, SV. As HR continues to rise above 160 bpm, CO actually decreases as SV falls faster\\nthan HR increases. So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the health of the heart, individuals are\\ncautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of between 120 and 160 bpm,\\nso CO is maintained. The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and lungs receive the\\nmaximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age.\\nCardiovascular Centers\\nNervous control over HR is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centers of the medulla oblongata (Figure\\n19.32). The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves,\\nand the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the\\nvagus nerve, cranial nerve X. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to\\nautonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as,\\nleft unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.\\nBoth sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulations flow through a paired complex network of nerve fibers known\\nas the cardiac plexus near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming\\nthe cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1–T4) to both the SA\\nsignificant. However, if any of these symptoms are present, they may indicate that the heart is not providing\\nsufficient oxygenated blood to the tissues. The term relative bradycardia may be used with a patient who has a\\nHR in the normal range but is still suffering from these symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic as long\\nas the HR remains above 50 bpm.\\nBradycardia may be caused by either inherent factors or causes external to the heart. While the condition may\\nbe inherited, typically it is acquired in older individuals. Inherent causes include abnormalities in either the SA or\\nAV node. If the condition is serious, a pacemaker may be required. Other causes include ischemia to the heart\\nmuscle or diseases of the heart vessels or valves. External causes include metabolic disorders, pathologies of\\nthe endocrine system often involving the thyroid, electrolyte imbalances, neurological disorders including\\ninappropriate autonomic responses, autoimmune pathologies, over-prescription of beta blocker drugs that\\nreduce HR, recreational drug use, or even prolonged bed rest. Treatment relies upon establishing the underlying\\ncause of the disorder and may necessitate supplemental oxygen.\\nTachycardia is not normal in a resting patient but may be detected in pregnant people or individuals\\nexperiencing extreme stress. In the latter case, it would likely be triggered by stimulation from the limbic system\\nor disorders of the autonomic nervous system. In some cases, tachycardia may involve only the atria. Some\\nindividuals may remain asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms may include dizziness, shortness of breath,\\nlightheadedness, rapid pulse, heart palpations, chest pain, or fainting (syncope). While tachycardia is defined as\\na HR above 100 bpm, there is considerable variation among people. Further, the normal resting HRs of children\\nare often above 100 bpm, but this is not considered to be tachycardia Many causes of tachycardia may be\\nbenign, but the condition may also be correlated with fever, anemia, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, hypersecretion of\\ncatecholamines, some cardiomyopathies, some disorders of the valves, and acute exposure to radiation.\\nElevated rates in an exercising or resting patient are normal and expected. Resting rate should always be taken\\nafter recovery from exercise.

The ventricles are more richly innervated by\\nsympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter\\nnorepinephrine (NE) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. NE shortens the repolarization period,\\nthus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increase in HR. It opens chemical- or\\nligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.\\nNE binds to the beta-1 receptor.

They innervate the heart via sympathetic cardiac nerves that increase cardiac activity\\nand vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that slow cardiac activity.\\nParasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve\\n(cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and\\nventricles.

The cardiac centers monitor these increased rates of firing, and suppress parasympathetic stimulation and\\nincrease sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow.\\nSimilarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other\\nlocations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors\\nrepresent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood.

Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located.\\nHowever, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood\\npressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic\\nstimulation to increase HR. The opposite is also true.\\nIncreased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and\\nlactic acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal\\nand vagus nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for\\nincreased or decreased blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.\\nThe limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not\\nunusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol.\\nIndividuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart\\nattacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease\\nanxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s\\neyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.\\nOther Factors Influencing Heart Rate\\nUsing a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively\\nprecise control over HR. However, there are a number of other factors that have an impact on HR as well, including\\nepinephrine, NE, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body\\ntemperature; hypoxia; and pH balance (Table 19.1 and Table 19.2).

This condition\\nmay also be called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, transient apical ballooning syndrome, apical ballooning\\ncardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, Gebrochenes-Herz syndrome, and stress cardiomyopathy. The\\nrecognized effects on the heart include congestive heart failure due to a profound weakening of the myocardium\\nnot related to lack of oxygen. This may lead to acute heart failure, lethal arrhythmias, or even the rupture of a\\nventricle. The exact etiology is not known, but several factors have been suggested, including transient\\nvasospasm, dysfunction of the cardiac capillaries, or thickening of the myocardium—particularly in the left\\nventricle—that may lead to the critical circulation of blood to this region. While many patients survive the initial\\nacute event with treatment to restore normal function, there is a strong correlation with death. Careful statistical\\nanalysis by the Jaap Spreeuw and Iqbal Owadally of Bayes Business School in London, revealed that within one\\nyear of the death of a loved one, women are more than twice as likely to die and men are six times as likely to die\\nas would otherwise be expected.

However, massive releases of these hormones coupled\\nwith sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the\\nadrenal medulla.\\nThyroid Hormones\\nIn general, increased levels of thyroid hormone, or thyroxin, increase cardiac rate and contractility. The impact of\\nthyroid hormone is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines. The physiologically active\\nform of thyroid hormone, T3 or triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity\\nat the level of the genome. It also impacts the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and NE described\\nabove. Excessive levels of thyroxin may trigger tachycardia.\\nCalcium\\nCalcium ion levels have great impacts upon both HR and contractility; as the levels of calcium ions increase, so do\\nHR and contractility. High levels of calcium ions (hypercalcemia) may be implicated in a short QT interval and a\\nwidened T wave in the ECG. The QT interval represents the time from the start of depolarization to repolarization of\\nthe ventricles, and includes the period of ventricular systole. Extremely high levels of calcium may induce cardiac\\narrest. Drugs known as calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the\\ninward movement of calcium ions.\\nCaffeine and Nicotine\\nCaffeine and nicotine are not found naturally within the body. Both of these nonregulated drugs have an excitatory\\neffect on membranes of neurons in general and have a stimulatory effect on the cardiac centers specifically, causing\\nan increase in HR. Caffeine works by increasing the rates of depolarization at the SA node, whereas nicotine\\nstimulates the activity of the sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.\\nAlthough it is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive drug, caffeine is legal and not regulated. While\\nprecise quantities have not been established, “normal” consumption is not considered harmful to most people,\\nalthough it may cause disruptions to sleep and acts as a diuretic. Its consumption by pregnant people is cautioned\\nagainst, although no evidence of negative effects has been confirmed. Tolerance and even physical and mental\\naddiction to the drug result in individuals who routinely consume the substance.\\nNicotine, too, is a stimulant and produces addiction. While legal and nonregulated, concerns about nicotine’s safety\\nand documented links to respiratory and cardiac disease have resulted in warning labels on cigarette packages.\\n19.4 • Cardiac Physiology 795'),\n",

The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte\\nbalance is critical to the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical\\nsignificance. Initially, both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to\\ntachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe\\nhyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to\\narrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and\\nultimately to fail.\\nAcidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patient’s blood expresses a low pH value.\\nAlkalosis is a condition in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patient’s blood has an elevated pH. Normal\\nblood pH falls in the range of 7.35–7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number\\nrepresents alkalosis. Recall that enzymes are the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions; they\\nare sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and\\naccompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the\\nenzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have\\ncomplex effects on HR. Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.\\nThe last variable is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body\\ntemperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction.\\nHypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component\\nof the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will\\nstop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patient’s blood is\\nnormally diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine to maintain the body’s blood supply and gas exchange until the\\nsurgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in\\ndeath, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.\\nStroke Volume\\nMany of the same factors that regulate HR also impact cardiac function by altering SV. While a number of variables\\nare involved, SV is ultimately dependent upon the difference between EDV and ESV. The three primary factors to\\nconsider are preload, or the stretch on the ventricles prior to contraction; the contractility, or the force or strength of\\nthe contraction itself; and afterload, the force the ventricles must generate to pump blood against the resistance in\\nthe vessels. These factors are summarized in Table 19.1 and Table 19.2.\\nPreload\\nPreload is another way of expressing EDV. Therefore, the greater the EDV is, the greater the preload is. One of the\\nprimary factors to consider is filling time, or the duration of ventricular diastole during which filling occurs. The\\nmore rapidly the heart contracts, the shorter the filling time becomes, and the lower the EDV and preload are. This\\neffect can be partially overcome by increasing the second variable, contractility, and raising SV, but over time, the\\nheart is unable to compensate for decreased filling time, and preload also decreases.\\nWith increasing ventricular filling, both EDV or preload increase, and the cardiac muscle itself is stretched to a\\ngreater degree. At rest, there is little stretch of the ventricular muscle, and the sarcomeres remain short. With\\nincreased ventricular filling, the ventricular muscle is increasingly stretched and the sarcomere length increases. As\\nthe sarcomeres reach their optimal lengths, they will contract more powerfully, because more of the myosin heads\\ncan bind to the actin on the thin filaments, forming cross bridges and increasing the strength of contraction and SV.\\nIf this process were to continue and the sarcomeres stretched beyond their optimal lengths, the force of contraction\\nwould decrease. However, due to the physical constraints of the location of the heart, this excessive stretch is not a\\nconcern.\\nThe relationship between ventricular stretch and contraction has been stated in the well-known Frank-Starling\\nmechanism or simply Starling’s Law of the Heart. This principle states that, within physiological limits, the force of\\nheart contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber. This means that the greater the\\nstretch of the ventricular muscle (within limits), the more powerful the contraction is, which in turn increases SV.\\nTherefore, by increasing preload, you increase the second variable, contractility.\\n796 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Ernest Starling (1866–1927) was an important English physiologist who also studied\\nthe heart. Although they worked largely independently, their combined efforts and similar conclusions have been\\nrecognized in the name “Frank-Starling mechanism.”\\nAny sympathetic stimulation to the venous system will increase venous return to the heart, which contributes to\\nventricular filling, and EDV and preload. While much of the ventricular filling occurs while both atria and ventricles\\nare in diastole, the contraction of the atria, the atrial kick, plays a crucial role by providing the last 20–30 percent of\\nventricular filling.\\nContractility\\nIt is virtually impossible to consider preload or ESV without including an early mention of the concept of\\ncontractility. Indeed, the two parameters are intimately linked. Contractility refers to the force of the contraction of\\nthe heart muscle, which controls SV, and is the primary parameter for impacting ESV. The more forceful the\\ncontraction is, the greater the SV and smaller the ESV are. Less forceful contractions result in smaller SVs and larger\\nESVs. Factors that increase contractility are described as positive inotropic factors, and those that decrease\\ncontractility are described as negative inotropic factors (ino- = “fiber;” -tropic = “turning toward”).\\nNot surprisingly, sympathetic stimulation is a positive inotrope, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is a negative\\ninotrope. Sympathetic stimulation triggers the release of NE at the neuromuscular junction from the cardiac nerves\\nand also stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete epinephrine and NE. In addition to their stimulatory effects on HR,\\nthey also bind to both alpha and beta receptors on the cardiac muscle cell membrane to increase metabolic rate and\\nthe force of contraction. This combination of actions has the net effect of increasing SV and leaving a smaller\\nresidual ESV in the ventricles. In comparison, parasympathetic stimulation releases ACh at the neuromuscular\\njunction from the vagus nerve. The membrane hyperpolarizes and inhibits contraction to decrease the strength of\\ncontraction and SV, and to raise ESV. Since parasympathetic fibers are more widespread in the atria than in the\\nventricles, the primary site of action is in the upper chambers. Parasympathetic stimulation in the atria decreases\\nthe atrial kick and reduces EDV, which decreases ventricular stretch and preload, thereby further limiting the force\\nof ventricular contraction. Stronger parasympathetic stimulation also directly decreases the force of contraction of\\nthe ventricles.\\nSeveral synthetic drugs, including dopamine and isoproterenol, have been developed that mimic the effects of\\nepinephrine and NE by stimulating the influx of calcium ions from the extracellular fluid. Higher concentrations of\\nintracellular calcium ions increase the strength of contraction. Excess calcium (hypercalcemia) also acts as a\\npositive inotropic agent. The drug digitalis lowers HR and increases the strength of the contraction, acting as a\\npositive inotropic agent by blocking the sequestering of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to\\nhigher intracellular calcium levels and greater strength of contraction. In addition to the catecholamines from the\\nadrenal medulla, other hormones also demonstrate positive inotropic effects. These include thyroid hormones and\\nglucagon from the pancreas.\\nNegative inotropic agents include hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a variety of synthetic drugs. These include\\nnumerous beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Early beta blocker drugs include propranolol and\\npronethalol, and are credited with revolutionizing treatment of cardiac patients experiencing angina pectoris. There\\nis also a large class of dihydropyridine, phenylalkylamine, and benzothiazepine calcium channel blockers that may\\nbe administered decreasing the strength of contraction and SV.\\nAfterload\\nAfterload refers to the tension that the ventricles must develop to pump blood effectively against the resistance in\\nthe vascular system. Any condition that increases resistance requires a greater afterload to force open the\\nsemilunar valves and pump the blood. Damage to the valves, such as stenosis, which makes them harder to open\\nwill also increase afterload. Any decrease in resistance decreases the afterload.

Following chemical signals called factors from the underlying endoderm (another of the three\\nprimary germ layers), the cardiogenic area begins to form two strands called the cardiogenic cords (Figure 19.36).\\nAs the cardiogenic cords develop, a lumen rapidly develops within them. At this point, they are referred to as\\nendocardial tubes. The two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube. The primitive\\nheart tube quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these include the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis,\\nprimitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus,\\nand contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. This is a\\nvery different pattern from that of an adult.\\nFIGURE 19.36 Development of the Human Heart This diagram outlines the embryological development of the human heart during the\\nfirst eight weeks and the subsequent formation of the four heart chambers.\\nThe five regions of the primitive heart tube develop into recognizable structures in a fully developed heart. The\\ntruncus arteriosus will eventually divide and give rise to the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The bulbus\\ncordis develops into the right ventricle. The primitive ventricle forms the left ventricle. The primitive atrium\\nbecomes the anterior portions of both the right and left atria, and the two auricles. The sinus venosus develops into\\nthe posterior portion of the right atrium, the SA node, and the coronary sinus.\\nAs the primitive heart tube elongates, it begins to fold within the pericardium, eventually forming an S shape, which\\nplaces the chambers and major vessels into an alignment similar to the adult heart. This process occurs between\\ndays 23 and 28. The remainder of the heart development pattern includes development of septa and valves, and\\nremodeling of the actual chambers. Partitioning of the atria and ventricles by the interatrial septum, interventricular\\nseptum, and atrioventricular septum is complete by the end of the fifth week, although the fetal blood shunts\\nremain until birth or shortly after. The atrioventricular valves form between weeks five and eight, and the semilunar\\nvalves form between weeks five and nine.\\n800 19 • The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The pericardial sac consists of two fused layers:\\nan outer fibrous capsule and an inner parietal\\npericardium lined with a serous membrane. Between\\nthe pericardial sac and the heart is the pericardial\\ncavity, which is filled with lubricating serous fluid. The\\nwalls of the heart are composed of an outer\\nepicardium, a thick myocardium, and an inner lining\\nlayer of endocardium. The human heart consists of a\\npair of atria, which receive blood and pump it into a\\npair of ventricles, which pump blood into the vessels.\\nThe right atrium receives systemic blood relatively low\\nin oxygen and pumps it into the right ventricle, which\\npumps it into the pulmonary circuit. Exchange of\\noxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the lungs, and\\nblood high in oxygen returns to the left atrium, which\\npumps blood into the left ventricle, which in turn\\npumps blood into the aorta and the remainder of the\\nsystemic circuit. The septa are the partitions that\\nseparate the chambers of the heart. They include the\\ninteratrial septum, the interventricular septum, and the\\natrioventricular septum. Two of these openings are\\nguarded by the atrioventricular valves, the right\\ntricuspid valve and the left mitral valve, which prevent\\nthe backflow of blood. Each is attached to chordae\\ntendineae that extend to the papillary muscles, which\\nare extensions of the myocardium, to prevent the\\nvalves from being blown back into the atria. The\\npulmonary valve is located at the base of the\\npulmonary trunk, and the left semilunar valve is\\nlocated at the base of the aorta. The right and left\\ncoronary arteries are the first to branch off the aorta\\nand arise from two of the three sinuses located near\\nthe base of the aorta and are generally located in the\\nsulci. Cardiac veins parallel the small cardiac arteries\\nand generally drain into the coronary sinus.\\n19.2 Cardiac Muscle and Electrical Activity\\nThe heart is regulated by both neural and endocrine\\ncontrol, yet it is capable of initiating its own action\\npotential followed by muscular contraction. The\\nconductive cells within the heart establish the heart\\nrate and transmit it through the myocardium. The\\ncontractile cells contract and propel the blood. The\\nnormal path of transmission for the conductive cells is\\nthe sinoatrial (SA) node, internodal pathways,\\natrioventricular (AV) node, atrioventricular (AV) bundle\\nof His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. The action\\npotential for the conductive cells consists of a\\nprepotential phase with a slow influx of Na+ followed\\nby a rapid influx of Ca2+ and outflux of K+. Contractile\\ncells have an action potential with an extended plateau\\nphase that results in an extended refractory period to\\nallow complete contraction for the heart to pump blood\\neffectively. Recognizable points on the ECG include the\\nP wave that corresponds to atrial depolarization, the\\nQRS complex that corresponds to ventricular\\ndepolarization, and the T wave that corresponds to\\nventricular repolarization.\\n19.3 Cardiac Cycle\\nThe cardiac cycle comprises a complete relaxation and\\ncontraction of both the atria and ventricles, and lasts\\napproximately 0.8 seconds. Beginning with all\\nchambers in diastole, blood flows passively from the\\nveins into the atria and past the atrioventricular valves\\ninto the ventricles. The atria begin to contract (atrial\\nsystole), following depolarization of the atria, and\\npump blood into the ventricles. The ventricles begin to\\ncontract (ventricular systole), raising pressure within\\nthe ventricles. When ventricular pressure rises above\\nthe pressure in the atria, blood flows toward the atria,\\nproducing the first heart sound, S1 or lub. As pressure\\nin the ventricles rises above two major arteries, blood\\npushes open the two semilunar valves and moves into\\nthe pulmonary trunk and aorta in the ventricular\\nejection phase. Following ventricular repolarization, the\\nventricles begin to relax (ventricular diastole), and\\npressure within the ventricles drops. As ventricular\\npressure drops, there is a tendency for blood to flow\\nback into the atria from the major arteries, producing\\nthe dicrotic notch in the ECG and closing the two\\nsemilunar valves. The second heart sound, S2 or dub,\\noccurs when the semilunar valves close. When the\\npressure falls below that of the atria, blood moves from\\nthe atria into the ventricles, opening the\\natrioventricular valves and marking one complete heart\\ncycle. The valves prevent backflow of blood. Failure of\\nthe valves to operate properly produces turbulent\\nblood flow within the heart; the resulting heart murmur\\ncan often be heard with a stethoscope.\\n19.4 Cardiac Physiology\\nMany factors affect HR and SV, and together, they\\ncontribute to cardiac function. HR is largely determined\\nand regulated by autonomic stimulation and hormones.\\nThere are several feedback loops that contribute to\\nmaintaining homeostasis dependent upon activity\\n19 • Chapter Review 805'),\n",

Originally, it consists of a pair of strands called\\ncardiogenic cords that quickly form a hollow lumen and\\nare referred to as endocardial tubes. These then fuse\\ninto a single heart tube and differentiate into the\\ntruncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle,\\nprimitive atrium, and sinus venosus, starting about day\\n22. The primitive heart begins to form an S shape\\nwithin the pericardium between days 23 and 28. The\\ninternal septa begin to form about day 28, separating\\nthe heart into the atria and ventricles, although the\\nforamen ovale persists until shortly after birth.\\nBetween weeks five and eight, the atrioventricular\\nvalves form.

An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the\\nheart, where it branches into ever-smaller vessels. Eventually, the smallest arteries, vessels called arterioles,\\nfurther branch into tiny capillaries, where nutrients and wastes are exchanged, and then combine with other vessels\\nthat exit capillaries to form venules, small blood vessels that carry blood to a vein, a larger blood vessel that returns\\nblood to the heart.\\nArteries and veins transport blood in two distinct circuits: the systemic circuit and the pulmonary circuit (Figure\\n20.2). Systemic arteries provide blood rich in oxygen to the body’s tissues. The blood returned to the heart through\\nsystemic veins has less oxygen, since much of the oxygen carried by the arteries has been delivered to the cells. In\\ncontrast, in the pulmonary circuit, arteries carry blood low in oxygen exclusively to the lungs for gas exchange.\\nPulmonary veins then return freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart to be pumped back out into\\nsystemic circulation. Although arteries and veins differ structurally and functionally, they share certain features.\\nFIGURE 20.2 Cardiovascular Circulation The pulmonary circuit moves blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and back to\\nthe heart. The systemic circuit moves blood from the left side of the heart to the head and body and returns it to the right side of the heart\\nto repeat the cycle. The arrows indicate the direction of blood flow, and the colors show the relative levels of oxygen concentration.\\nShared Structures\\nDifferent types of blood vessels vary slightly in their structures, but they share the same general features. Arteries\\nand arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and receive blood that\\nis surging at a far greater pressure (Figure 20.3). Each type of vessel has a lumen—a hollow passageway through\\nwhich blood flows. Arteries have smaller lumens than veins, a characteristic that helps to maintain the pressure of\\nblood moving through the system. Together, their thicker walls and smaller diameters give arterial lumens a more\\nrounded appearance in cross section than the lumens of veins.\\n810 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

(c) A micrograph shows the relative differences in thickness.\\nLM × 160. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of the University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\\nBy the time blood has passed through capillaries and entered venules, the pressure initially exerted upon it by heart\\ncontractions has diminished. In other words, in comparison to arteries, venules and veins withstand a much lower\\npressure from the blood that flows through them. Their walls are considerably thinner and their lumens are\\ncorrespondingly larger in diameter, allowing more blood to flow with less vessel resistance. In addition, many veins\\nof the body, particularly those of the limbs, contain valves that assist the unidirectional flow of blood toward the\\nheart. This is critical because blood flow becomes sluggish in the extremities, as a result of the lower pressure and\\nthe effects of gravity.\\nThe walls of arteries and veins are largely composed of living cells and their products (including collagenous and\\nelastic fibers); the cells require nourishment and produce waste. Since blood passes through the larger vessels\\nrelatively quickly, there is limited opportunity for blood in the lumen of the vessel to provide nourishment to or\\nremove waste from the vessel’s cells. Further, the walls of the larger vessels are too thick for nutrients to diffuse\\nthrough to all of the cells. Larger arteries and veins contain small blood vessels within their walls known as the vasa\\nvasorum—literally “vessels of the vessel”—to provide them with this critical exchange. Since the pressure within\\narteries is relatively high, the vasa vasorum must function in the outer layers of the vessel (see Figure 20.3) or the\\npressure exerted by the blood passing through the vessel would collapse it, preventing any exchange from\\noccurring. The lower pressure within veins allows the vasa vasorum to be located closer to the lumen. The\\n20.1 • Structure and Function of Blood Vessels 811'),\n",

There are also minute nerves within the walls of both types of vessels that control the\\ncontraction and dilation of smooth muscle. These minute nerves are known as the nervi vasorum.\\nBoth arteries and veins have the same three distinct tissue layers, called tunics (from the Latin term tunica), for the\\ngarments first worn by ancient Romans; the term tunic is also used for some modern garments. From the most\\ninterior layer to the outer, these tunics are the tunica intima, the tunica media, and the tunica externa (see Figure\\n20.3).

Lining the\\ntunica intima is the specialized simple squamous epithelium called the endothelium, which is continuous\\nthroughout the entire vascular system, including the lining of the chambers of the heart. Damage to this endothelial\\nlining and exposure of blood to the collagenous fibers beneath is one of the primary causes of clot formation. Until\\nrecently, the endothelium was viewed simply as the boundary between the blood in the lumen and the walls of the\\nvessels. Recent studies, however, have shown that it is physiologically critical to such activities as helping to\\nregulate capillary exchange and altering blood flow. The endothelium releases local chemicals called endothelins\\nthat can constrict the smooth muscle within the walls of the vessel to increase blood pressure. Uncompensated\\noverproduction of endothelins may contribute to hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiovascular disease.\\nNext to the endothelium is the basement membrane, or basal lamina, that effectively binds the endothelium to the\\nconnective tissue. The basement membrane provides strength while maintaining flexibility, and it is permeable,\\n812 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The thin outer layer of the tunica intima contains a small amount of areolar\\nconnective tissue that consists primarily of elastic fibers to provide the vessel with additional flexibility; it also\\ncontains some collagenous fibers to provide additional strength.\\nIn larger arteries, there is also a thick, distinct layer of elastic fibers known as the internal elastic membrane (also\\ncalled the internal elastic lamina) at the boundary with the tunica media. Like the other components of the tunica\\nintima, the internal elastic membrane provides structure while allowing the vessel to stretch. It is permeated with\\nsmall openings that allow exchange of materials between the tunics. The internal elastic membrane is not apparent\\nin veins. In addition, many veins, particularly in the lower limbs, contain valves formed by sections of thickened\\nendothelium that are reinforced with connective tissue, extending into the lumen.\\nUnder the microscope, the lumen and the entire tunica intima of a vein will appear smooth, whereas those of an\\nartery will normally appear wavy because of the partial constriction of the smooth muscle in the tunica media, the\\nnext layer of blood vessel walls.\\nTunica Media\\nThe tunica media is the substantial middle layer of the vessel wall (see Figure 20.3). It is generally the thickest\\nlayer in arteries, and it is much thicker in arteries than it is in veins. The tunica media consists of layers of smooth\\nmuscle supported by connective tissue that is primarily made up of elastic fibers, most of which are arranged in\\ncircular sheets. Toward the outer portion of the tunic, there are also layers of longitudinal muscle. Contraction and\\nrelaxation of the circular muscles decrease and increase the diameter of the vessel lumen, respectively. Specifically\\nin arteries, vasoconstriction decreases blood flow as the smooth muscle in the walls of the tunica media contracts,\\nmaking the lumen narrower and increasing blood pressure. Similarly, vasodilation increases blood flow as the\\nsmooth muscle relaxes, allowing the lumen to widen and blood pressure to drop. Both vasoconstriction and\\nvasodilation are regulated in part by small vascular nerves, known as nervi vasorum, or “nerves of the vessel,” that\\nrun within the walls of blood vessels. These are generally all sympathetic fibers, although some trigger vasodilation\\nand others induce vasoconstriction, depending upon the nature of the neurotransmitter and receptors located on\\nthe target cell. Parasympathetic stimulation does trigger vasodilation as well as erection during sexual arousal in the\\nexternal genitalia of both sexes. Nervous control over vessels tends to be more generalized than the specific\\ntargeting of individual blood vessels. Local controls, discussed later, account for this phenomenon. (Seek additional\\ncontent for more information on these dynamic aspects of the autonomic nervous system.) Hormones and local\\nchemicals also control blood vessels. Together, these neural and chemical mechanisms reduce or increase blood\\nflow in response to changing body conditions, from exercise to hydration. Regulation of both blood flow and blood\\npressure is discussed in detail later in this chapter.\\nThe smooth muscle layers of the tunica media are supported by a framework of collagenous fibers that also binds\\nthe tunica media to the inner and outer tunics. Along with the collagenous fibers are large numbers of elastic fibers\\nthat appear as wavy lines in prepared slides. Separating the tunica media from the outer tunica externa in larger\\narteries is the external elastic membrane (also called the external elastic lamina), which also appears wavy in\\nslides. This structure is not usually seen in smaller arteries, nor is it seen in veins.\\nTunica Externa\\nThe outer tunic, the tunica externa (also called the tunica adventitia), is a substantial sheath of connective tissue\\ncomposed primarily of collagenous fibers. Some bands of elastic fibers are found here as well. The tunica externa in\\nveins also contains groups of smooth muscle fibers. This is normally the thickest tunic in veins and may be thicker\\nthan the tunica media in some larger arteries. The outer layers of the tunica externa are not distinct but rather blend\\nwith the surrounding connective tissue outside the vessel, helping to hold the vessel in relative position. If you are\\nable to palpate some of the superficial veins on your upper limbs and try to move them, you will find that the tunica\\nexterna prevents this. If the tunica externa did not hold the vessel in place, any movement would likely result in\\ndisruption of blood flow.\\nArteries\\nAn artery is a blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart. All arteries have relatively thick walls that can\\nwithstand the high pressure of blood ejected from the heart. However, those close to the heart have the thickest\\nwalls, containing a high percentage of elastic fibers in all three of their tunics. This type of artery is known as an\\nelastic artery (Figure 20.4). Vessels larger than 10 mm in diameter are typically elastic. Their abundant elastic\\n20.1 • Structure and Function of Blood Vessels 813'),\n",

If artery walls were rigid and unable to expand and recoil, their resistance to blood flow would\\ngreatly increase and blood pressure would rise to even higher levels, which would in turn require the heart to pump\\nharder to increase the volume of blood expelled by each pump (the stroke volume) and maintain adequate pressure\\nand flow. Artery walls would have to become even thicker in response to this increased pressure. The elastic recoil\\nof the vascular wall helps to maintain the pressure gradient that drives the blood through the arterial system. An\\nelastic artery is also known as a conducting artery, because the large diameter of the lumen enables it to accept a\\nlarge volume of blood from the heart and conduct it to smaller branches.\\nFIGURE 20.4 Types of Arteries and Arterioles Comparison of the walls of an elastic artery, a muscular artery, and an arteriole is\\nshown. In terms of scale, the diameter of an arteriole is measured in micrometers compared to millimeters for elastic and muscular\\narteries.\\nFarther from the heart, where the surge of blood has dampened, the percentage of elastic fibers in an artery’s tunica\\nintima decreases and the amount of smooth muscle in its tunica media increases. The artery at this point is\\ndescribed as a muscular artery. The diameter of muscular arteries typically ranges from 0.1 mm to 10 mm. Their\\nthick tunica media allows muscular arteries to play a leading role in vasoconstriction. In contrast, their decreased\\nquantity of elastic fibers limits their ability to expand. Fortunately, because the blood pressure has eased by the\\ntime it reaches these more distant vessels, elasticity has become less important.\\nNotice that although the distinctions between elastic and muscular arteries are important, there is no “line of\\ndemarcation” where an elastic artery suddenly becomes muscular. Rather, there is a gradual transition as the\\nvascular tree repeatedly branches. In turn, muscular arteries branch to distribute blood to the vast network of\\narterioles. For this reason, a muscular artery is also known as a distributing artery.\\nArterioles\\nAn arteriole is a very small artery that leads to a capillary. Arterioles have the same three tunics as the larger\\nvessels, but the thickness of each is greatly diminished. The critical endothelial lining of the tunica intima is intact.\\nThe tunica media is restricted to one or two smooth muscle cell layers in thickness. The tunica externa remains but\\nis very thin (see Figure 20.4).\\nWith a lumen averaging 30 micrometers or less in diameter, arterioles are critical in slowing down—or\\nresisting—blood flow and, thus, causing a substantial drop in blood pressure. Because of this, you may see them\\nreferred to as resistance vessels. The muscle fibers in arterioles are normally slightly contracted, causing arterioles\\nto maintain a consistent muscle tone—in this case referred to as vascular tone—in a similar manner to the muscular\\ntone of skeletal muscle. In reality, all blood vessels exhibit vascular tone due to the partial contraction of smooth\\nmuscle. The importance of the arterioles is that they will be the primary site of both resistance and regulation of\\nblood pressure. The precise diameter of the lumen of an arteriole at any given moment is determined by neural and\\nchemical controls, and vasoconstriction and vasodilation in the arterioles are the primary mechanisms for\\ndistribution of blood flow.\\nCapillaries\\nA capillary is a microscopic channel that supplies blood to the tissues, a process called perfusion. Exchange of\\ngases and other substances occurs between the blood in capillaries and the surrounding cells and their tissue fluid\\n(interstitial fluid). The diameter of a capillary lumen ranges from 5–10 micrometers; the smallest are just barely\\nwide enough for an erythrocyte to squeeze through. Flow through capillaries is often described as microcirculation.\\nThe wall of a capillary consists of the endothelial layer surrounded by a basement membrane with occasional\\n814 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

There is some variation in wall structure: In a large capillary, several endothelial cells\\nbordering each other may line the lumen; in a small capillary, there may be only a single cell layer that wraps around\\nto contact itself.\\nFor capillaries to function, their walls must be leaky, allowing substances to pass through. There are three major\\ntypes of capillaries, which differ according to their degree of “leakiness:” continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoid\\ncapillaries (Figure 20.5).\\nContinuous Capillaries\\nThe most common type of capillary, the continuous capillary, is found in almost all vascularized tissues. Continuous\\ncapillaries are characterized by a complete endothelial lining with tight junctions between endothelial cells.\\nAlthough a tight junction is usually impermeable and only allows for the passage of water and ions, they are often\\nincomplete in capillaries, leaving intercellular clefts that allow for exchange of water and other very small molecules\\nbetween the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid. Substances that can pass between cells include metabolic\\nproducts, such as glucose, water, and small hydrophobic molecules like gases and hormones, as well as various\\nleukocytes. Continuous capillaries not associated with the brain are rich in transport vesicles, contributing to either\\nendocytosis or exocytosis. Those in the brain are part of the blood-brain barrier. Here, there are tight junctions and\\nno intercellular clefts, plus a thick basement membrane and astrocyte extensions called end feet; these structures\\ncombine to prevent the movement of nearly all substances.\\nFIGURE 20.5 Types of Capillaries The three major types of capillaries: continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoid.\\nFenestrated Capillaries\\nA fenestrated capillary is one that has pores (or fenestrations) in addition to tight junctions in the endothelial lining.\\nThese make the capillary permeable to larger molecules. The number of fenestrations and their degree of\\npermeability vary, however, according to their location. Fenestrated capillaries are common in the small intestine,\\nwhich is the primary site of nutrient absorption, as well as in the kidneys, which filter the blood. They are also found\\nin the choroid plexus of the brain and many endocrine structures, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, and\\nthyroid glands.\\nSinusoid Capillaries\\nA sinusoid capillary (or sinusoid) is the least common type of capillary. Sinusoid capillaries are flattened, and they\\nhave extensive intercellular gaps and incomplete basement membranes, in addition to intercellular clefts and\\nfenestrations. This gives them an appearance not unlike Swiss cheese. These very large openings allow for the\\npassage of the largest molecules, including plasma proteins and even cells. Blood flow through sinusoids is very\\nslow, allowing more time for exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes. Sinusoids are found in the liver and spleen,\\nbone marrow, lymph nodes (where they carry lymph, not blood), and many endocrine glands including the pituitary\\nand adrenal glands. Without these specialized capillaries, these organs would not be able to provide their myriad of\\nfunctions. For example, when bone marrow forms new blood cells, the cells must enter the blood supply and can\\nonly do so through the large openings of a sinusoid capillary; they cannot pass through the small openings of\\ncontinuous or fenestrated capillaries. The liver also requires extensive specialized sinusoid capillaries in order to\\nprocess the materials brought to it by the hepatic portal vein from both the digestive tract and spleen, and to release\\nplasma proteins into circulation.\\n20.1 • Structure and Function of Blood Vessels 815'),\n",

Slightly\\nlarger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but\\nforms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. Each metarteriole arises from a\\nterminal arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10–100 capillaries.\\nThe precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the\\nmetarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies. Their function is\\ncritical: If all of the capillary beds in the body were to open simultaneously, they would collectively hold every drop\\nof blood in the body and there would be none in the arteries, arterioles, venules, veins, or the heart itself. Normally,\\nthe precapillary sphincters are closed. When the surrounding tissues need oxygen and have excess waste products,\\nthe precapillary sphincters open, allowing blood to flow through and exchange to occur before closing once more\\n(Figure 20.6). If all of the precapillary sphincters in a capillary bed are closed, blood will flow from the metarteriole\\ndirectly into a thoroughfare channel and then into the venous circulation, bypassing the capillary bed entirely. This\\ncreates what is known as a vascular shunt. In addition, an arteriovenous anastomosis may bypass the capillary\\nbed and lead directly to the venous system.\\nAlthough you might expect blood flow through a capillary bed to be smooth, in reality, it moves with an irregular,\\npulsating flow. This pattern is called vasomotion and is regulated by chemical signals that are triggered in response\\nto changes in internal conditions, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels. For example,\\nduring strenuous exercise when oxygen levels decrease and carbon dioxide, hydrogen ion, and lactic acid levels all\\nincrease, the capillary beds in skeletal muscle are open, as they would be in the digestive system when nutrients are\\npresent in the digestive tract. During sleep or rest periods, vessels in both areas are largely closed; they open only\\noccasionally to allow oxygen and nutrient supplies to travel to the tissues to maintain basic life processes.\\nFIGURE 20.6 Capillary Bed In a capillary bed, arterioles give rise to metarterioles. Precapillary sphincters located at the junction of a\\nmetarteriole with a capillary regulate blood flow. A thoroughfare channel connects the metarteriole to a venule.

Postcapillary venules join multiple\\ncapillaries exiting from a capillary bed. Multiple venules join to form veins. The walls of venules consist of\\nendothelium, a thin middle layer with a few muscle cells and elastic fibers, plus an outer layer of connective tissue\\nfibers that constitute a very thin tunica externa (Figure 20.7). Venules as well as capillaries are the primary sites of\\nemigration or diapedesis, in which the white blood cells adhere to the endothelial lining of the vessels and then\\nsqueeze through adjacent cells to enter the tissue fluid.\\n816 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

It is initiated by the contraction of the ventricles of the heart. Ventricular\\ncontraction ejects blood into the major arteries, resulting in flow from regions of higher pressure to regions of lower\\npressure, as blood encounters smaller arteries and arterioles, then capillaries, then the venules and veins of the\\nvenous system. This section discusses a number of critical variables that contribute to blood flow throughout the\\nbody. It also discusses the factors that impede or slow blood flow, a phenomenon known as resistance.\\nAs noted earlier, hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by a fluid due to gravitational pull, usually against the wall\\nof the container in which it is located. One form of hydrostatic pressure is blood pressure, the force exerted by\\nblood upon the walls of the blood vessels or the chambers of the heart. Blood pressure may be measured in\\ncapillaries and veins, as well as the vessels of the pulmonary circulation; however, the term blood pressure without\\nany specific descriptors typically refers to systemic arterial blood pressure—that is, the pressure of blood flowing in\\nthe arteries of the systemic circulation. In clinical practice, this pressure is measured in mm Hg and is usually\\nobtained using the brachial artery of the arm.\\nComponents of Arterial Blood Pressure\\nArterial blood pressure in the larger vessels consists of several distinct components (Figure 20.10): systolic and\\ndiastolic pressures, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure.\\nSystolic and Diastolic Pressures\\nWhen systemic arterial blood pressure is measured, it is recorded as a ratio of two numbers (e.g., 120/80 is a\\nnormal adult blood pressure), expressed as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the\\nhigher value (typically around 120 mm Hg) and reflects the arterial pressure resulting from the ejection of blood\\nduring ventricular contraction, or systole. The diastolic pressure is the lower value (usually about 80 mm Hg) and\\nrepresents the arterial pressure of blood during ventricular relaxation, or diastole.\\n20.2 • Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance 821'),\n",

For example, an individual with a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg\\nwould have a pulse pressure of 40 mmHg.\\nGenerally, a pulse pressure should be at least 25 percent of the systolic pressure. A pulse pressure below this level\\nis described as low or narrow. This may occur, for example, in patients with a low stroke volume, which may be seen\\nin congestive heart failure, stenosis of the aortic valve, or significant blood loss following trauma. In contrast, a high\\nor wide pulse pressure is common in healthy people following strenuous exercise, when their resting pulse pressure\\nof 30–40 mm Hg may increase temporarily to 100 mm Hg as stroke volume increases. A persistently high pulse\\npressure at or above 100 mm Hg may indicate excessive resistance in the arteries and can be caused by a variety of\\ndisorders. Chronic high resting pulse pressures can degrade the heart, brain, and kidneys, and warrant medical\\ntreatment.\\nMean Arterial Pressure\\nMean arterial pressure (MAP) represents the “average” pressure of blood in the arteries, that is, the average force\\ndriving blood into vessels that serve the tissues. Mean is a statistical concept and is calculated by taking the sum of\\nthe values divided by the number of values. Although complicated to measure directly and complicated to calculate,\\nMAP can be approximated by adding the diastolic pressure to one-third of the pulse pressure or systolic pressure\\nminus the diastolic pressure:\\nIn Figure 20.10, this value is approximately 80 + (120 − 80) / 3, or 93.33. Normally, the MAP falls within the range of\\n70–110 mm Hg. If the value falls below 60 mm Hg for an extended time, blood pressure will not be high enough to\\nensure circulation to and through the tissues, which results in ischemia, or insufficient blood flow. A condition\\ncalled hypoxia, inadequate oxygenation of tissues, commonly accompanies ischemia. The term hypoxemia refers to\\nlow levels of oxygen in systemic arterial blood. Neurons are especially sensitive to hypoxia and may die or be\\ndamaged if blood flow and oxygen supplies are not quickly restored.\\n822 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Turbulent blood flow through the vessels can be heard as a soft ticking while measuring blood pressure;\\nthese sounds are known as Korotkoff sounds. The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a\\nsphygmomanometer (a blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The technique is as\\nfollows:\\n• The clinician wraps an inflatable cuff tightly around the patient’s arm at about the level of the heart.\\n• The clinician squeezes a rubber pump to inject air into the cuff, raising pressure around the artery and\\ntemporarily cutting off blood flow into the patient’s arm.\\n• The clinician places the stethoscope on the patient’s antecubital region and, while gradually allowing air within\\nthe cuff to escape, listens for the Korotkoff sounds.\\nAlthough there are five recognized Korotkoff sounds, only two are normally recorded. Initially, no sounds are heard\\nsince there is no blood flow through the vessels, but as air pressure drops, the cuff relaxes, and blood flow returns\\nto the arm. As shown in Figure 20.12, the first sound heard through the stethoscope—the first Korotkoff\\nsound—indicates systolic pressure. As more air is released from the cuff, blood is able to flow freely through the\\nbrachial artery and all sounds disappear. The point at which the last sound is heard is recorded as the patient’s\\ndiastolic pressure.\\nFIGURE 20.12 Blood Pressure Measurement When pressure in a sphygmomanometer cuff is released, a clinician can hear the\\nKorotkoff sounds. In this graph, a blood pressure tracing is aligned to a measurement of systolic and diastolic pressures.\\nThe majority of hospitals and clinics have automated equipment for measuring blood pressure that work on the\\nsame principles. An even more recent innovation is a small instrument that wraps around a patient’s wrist. The\\npatient then holds the wrist over the heart while the device measures blood flow and records pressure.\\nVariables Affecting Blood Flow and Blood Pressure\\nFive variables influence blood flow and blood pressure:\\n• Cardiac output\\n• Compliance\\n• Volume of the blood\\n• Viscosity of the blood\\n• Blood vessel length and diameter\\nRecall that blood moves from higher pressure to lower pressure. It is pumped from the heart into the arteries at high\\npressure. If you increase pressure in the arteries (afterload), and cardiac function does not compensate, blood flow\\nwill actually decrease. In the venous system, the opposite relationship is true. Increased pressure in the veins does\\nnot decrease flow as it does in arteries, but actually increases flow. Since pressure in the veins is normally relatively\\nlow, for blood to flow back into the heart, the pressure in the atria during atrial diastole must be even lower. It\\nnormally approaches zero, except when the atria contract (see Figure 20.10).\\n824 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Any factor that causes cardiac output to increase, by elevating heart rate or stroke volume or both,\\nwill elevate blood pressure and promote blood flow. These factors include sympathetic stimulation, the\\ncatecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, thyroid hormones, and increased calcium ion levels. Conversely,\\nany factor that decreases cardiac output, by decreasing heart rate or stroke volume or both, will decrease arterial\\npressure and blood flow. These factors include parasympathetic stimulation, elevated or decreased potassium ion\\nlevels, decreased calcium levels, anoxia, and acidosis.\\nCompliance\\nCompliance is the ability of any compartment to expand to accommodate increased content. A metal pipe, for\\nexample, is not compliant, whereas a balloon is. The greater the compliance of an artery, the more effectively it is\\nable to expand to accommodate surges in blood flow without increased resistance or blood pressure. Veins are\\nmore compliant than arteries and can expand to hold more blood. When vascular disease causes stiffening of\\narteries, compliance is reduced and resistance to blood flow is increased. The result is more turbulence, higher\\npressure within the vessel, and reduced blood flow. This increases the work of the heart.\\nA Mathematical Approach to Factors Affecting Blood Flow\\nJean Louis Marie Poiseuille was a French physician and physiologist who devised a mathematical equation\\ndescribing blood flow and its relationship to known parameters. The same equation also applies to engineering\\nstudies of the flow of fluids. Although understanding the math behind the relationships among the factors affecting\\nblood flow is not necessary to understand blood flow, it can help solidify an understanding of their relationships.\\nPlease note that even if the equation looks intimidating, breaking it down into its components and following the\\nrelationships will make these relationships clearer, even if you are weak in math.

Water may merely\\ntrickle along a creek bed in a dry season, but rush quickly and under great pressure after a heavy rain. Similarly, as\\nblood volume decreases, pressure and flow decrease. As blood volume increases, pressure and flow increase.\\nUnder normal circumstances, blood volume varies little. Low blood volume, called hypovolemia, may be caused by\\nbleeding, dehydration, vomiting, severe burns, or some medications used to treat hypertension. It is important to\\nrecognize that other regulatory mechanisms in the body are so effective at maintaining blood pressure that an\\nindividual may be asymptomatic until 10–20 percent of the blood volume has been lost. Treatment typically\\nincludes intravenous fluid replacement.\\nHypervolemia, excessive fluid volume, may be caused by retention of water and sodium, as seen in patients with\\nheart failure, liver cirrhosis, some forms of kidney disease, hyperaldosteronism, and some glucocorticoid steroid\\ntreatments. Restoring homeostasis in these patients depends upon reversing the condition that triggered the\\nhypervolemia.\\nBlood Viscosity\\nViscosity is the thickness of fluids that affects their ability to flow. Clean water, for example, is less viscous than\\nmud. The viscosity of blood is directly proportional to resistance and inversely proportional to flow; therefore, any\\ncondition that causes viscosity to increase will also increase resistance and decrease flow. For example, imagine\\nsipping milk, then a milkshake, through the same size straw. You experience more resistance and therefore less flow\\nfrom the milkshake. Conversely, any condition that causes viscosity to decrease (such as when the milkshake melts)\\nwill decrease resistance and increase flow.\\nNormally the viscosity of blood does not change over short periods of time. The two primary determinants of blood\\nviscosity are the formed elements and plasma proteins. Since the vast majority of formed elements are\\nerythrocytes, any condition affecting erythropoiesis, such as polycythemia or anemia, can alter viscosity. Since most\\nplasma proteins are produced by the liver, any condition affecting liver function can also change the viscosity slightly\\nand therefore alter blood flow. Liver abnormalities such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcohol damage, and drug toxicities\\nresult in decreased levels of plasma proteins, which decrease blood viscosity. While leukocytes and platelets are\\nnormally a small component of the formed elements, there are some rare conditions in which severe overproduction\\ncan impact viscosity as well.\\nVessel Length and Diameter\\nThe length of a vessel is directly proportional to its resistance: the longer the vessel, the greater the resistance and\\nthe lower the flow. As with blood volume, this makes intuitive sense, since the increased surface area of the vessel\\nwill impede the flow of blood. Likewise, if the vessel is shortened, the resistance will decrease and flow will\\nincrease.\\nThe length of our blood vessels increases throughout childhood as we grow, of course, but is unchanging in adults\\nunder normal physiological circumstances. Further, the distribution of vessels is not the same in all tissues. Adipose\\ntissue does not have an extensive vascular supply. One pound of adipose tissue contains approximately 200 miles of\\nvessels, whereas skeletal muscle contains more than twice that. Overall, vessels decrease in length only during loss\\nof mass or amputation. An individual weighing 150 pounds has approximately 60,000 miles of vessels in the body.\\nGaining about 10 pounds adds from 2000 to 4000 miles of vessels, depending upon the nature of the gained tissue.\\nOne of the great benefits of weight reduction is the reduced stress to the heart, which does not have to overcome\\nthe resistance of as many miles of vessels.\\nIn contrast to length, the diameter of blood vessels changes throughout the body, according to the type of vessel, as\\nwe discussed earlier. The diameter of any given vessel may also change frequently throughout the day in response\\nto neural and chemical signals that trigger vasodilation and vasoconstriction. The vascular tone of the vessel is the\\ncontractile state of the smooth muscle and the primary determinant of diameter, and thus of resistance and flow.\\nThe effect of vessel diameter on resistance is inverse: Given the same volume of blood, an increased diameter\\nmeans there is less blood contacting the vessel wall, thus lower friction and lower resistance, subsequently\\nincreasing flow. A decreased diameter means more of the blood contacts the vessel wall, and resistance increases,\\n826 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

This is because resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the blood\\nvessel (one-half of the vessel’s diameter) raised to the fourth power (R = 1/r4). This means, for example, that if an\\nartery or arteriole constricts to one-half of its original radius, the resistance to flow will increase 16 times. And if an\\nartery or arteriole dilates to twice its initial radius, then resistance in the vessel will decrease to 1/16 of its original\\nvalue and flow will increase 16 times.\\nThe Roles of Vessel Diameter and Total Area in Blood Flow and Blood Pressure\\nRecall that we classified arterioles as resistance vessels, because given their small lumen, they dramatically slow\\nthe flow of blood from arteries. In fact, arterioles are the site of greatest resistance in the entire vascular network.\\nThis may seem surprising, given that capillaries have a smaller size. How can this phenomenon be explained?\\nFigure 20.13 compares vessel diameter, total cross-sectional area, average blood pressure, and blood velocity\\nthrough the systemic vessels. Notice in parts (a) and (b) that the total cross-sectional area of the body’s capillary\\nbeds is far greater than any other type of vessel. Although the diameter of an individual capillary is significantly\\nsmaller than the diameter of an arteriole, there are vastly more capillaries in the body than there are other types of\\nblood vessels. Part (c) shows that blood pressure drops unevenly as blood travels from arteries to arterioles,\\ncapillaries, venules, and veins, and encounters greater resistance. However, the site of the most precipitous drop,\\nand the site of greatest resistance, is the arterioles. This explains why vasodilation and vasoconstriction of arterioles\\nplay more significant roles in regulating blood pressure than do the vasodilation and vasoconstriction of other\\nvessels.\\nPart (d) shows that the velocity (speed) of blood flow decreases dramatically as the blood moves from arteries to\\narterioles to capillaries. This slow flow rate allows more time for exchange processes to occur. As blood flows\\nthrough the veins, the rate of velocity increases, as blood is returned to the heart.\\nFIGURE 20.13 Relationships among Vessels in the Systemic Circuit The relationships among blood vessels that can be compared\\ninclude (a) vessel diameter, (b) total cross-sectional area, (c) average blood pressure, and (d) velocity of blood flow.\\n20.2 • Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance 827'),\n",

This helps promote blood flow. In arteriosclerosis, compliance is reduced, and pressure\\nand resistance within the vessel increase. This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as\\nit causes the heart to work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance.\\nArteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high\\nblood glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors. Artery walls that are constantly\\nstressed by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension\\ncan promote arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it.\\nRecall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars\\nit, leaving it stiff (sclerotic). As a result, compliance is reduced. Moreover, circulating triglycerides and\\ncholesterol can seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they\\nare frequently joined by leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris. Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can\\nnarrow arteries enough to impair blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = “porridge”)\\ndescribes the mealy deposits (Figure 20.14).\\nFIGURE 20.14 Atherosclerosis (a) Atherosclerosis can result from plaques formed by the buildup of fatty, calcified deposits in an\\nartery. (b) Plaques can also take other forms, as shown in this micrograph of a coronary artery that has a buildup of connective tissue\\nwithin the artery wall. LM × 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\\nSometimes a plaque can rupture, causing microscopic tears in the artery wall that allow blood to leak into the\\ntissue on the other side. When this happens, platelets rush to the site to clot the blood. This clot can further\\nobstruct the artery and—if it occurs in a coronary or cerebral artery—cause a sudden heart attack or stroke.\\nAlternatively, plaque can break off and travel through the bloodstream as an embolus until it blocks a more\\ndistant, smaller artery.\\nEven without total blockage, vessel narrowing leads to ischemia—reduced blood flow—to the tissue region\\n“downstream” of the narrowed vessel. Ischemia in turn leads to hypoxia—decreased supply of oxygen to the\\ntissues. Hypoxia involving cardiac muscle or brain tissue can lead to cell death and severe impairment of brain or\\nheart function.\\nA major risk factor for both arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis is advanced age, as the conditions tend to\\nprogress over time.

If blood is to flow from the veins back into the heart, the pressure in the veins must be greater\\nthan the pressure in the atria of the heart. Two factors help maintain this pressure gradient between the veins and\\nthe heart. First, the pressure in the atria during diastole is very low, often approaching zero when the atria are\\nrelaxed (atrial diastole). Second, two physiologic “pumps” increase pressure in the venous system. The use of the\\nterm “pump” implies a physical device that speeds flow. These physiological pumps are less obvious.\\nSkeletal Muscle Pump\\nIn many body regions, the pressure within the veins can be increased by the contraction of the surrounding skeletal\\nmuscle. This mechanism, known as the skeletal muscle pump (Figure 20.15), helps the lower-pressure veins\\ncounteract the force of gravity, increasing pressure to move blood back to the heart. As leg muscles contract, for\\nexample during walking or running, they exert pressure on nearby veins with their numerous one-way valves. This\\nincreased pressure causes blood to flow upward, opening valves superior to the contracting muscles so blood flows\\nthrough. Simultaneously, valves inferior to the contracting muscles close; thus, blood should not seep back\\ndownward toward the feet. Military recruits are trained to flex their legs slightly while standing at attention for\\nprolonged periods. Failure to do so may allow blood to pool in the lower limbs rather than returning to the heart.\\nConsequently, the brain will not receive enough oxygenated blood, and the individual may lose consciousness.\\nFIGURE 20.15 Skeletal Muscle Pump The contraction of skeletal muscles surrounding a vein compresses the blood and increases the\\npressure in that area. This action forces blood closer to the heart where venous pressure is lower. Note the importance of the one-way\\nhypertension and/or diabetes also greatly increase the risk. However, obesity, poor nutrition, lack of physical\\nactivity, and tobacco use all are major risk factors.\\nTreatment includes lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adoption of\\na diet low in sodium and saturated fats. Medications to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure may be\\nprescribed. For blocked coronary arteries, surgery is warranted. In angioplasty, a catheter is inserted into the\\nvessel at the point of narrowing, and a second catheter with a balloon-like tip is inflated to widen the opening. To\\nprevent subsequent collapse of the vessel, a small mesh tube called a stent is often inserted. In an\\nendarterectomy, plaque is surgically removed from the walls of a vessel. This operation is typically performed on\\nthe carotid arteries of the neck, which are a prime source of oxygenated blood for the brain. In a coronary\\nbypass procedure, a non-vital superficial vessel from another part of the body (often the great saphenous vein)\\nor a synthetic vessel is inserted to create a path around the blocked area of a coronary artery.\\n20.2 • Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and Resistance 829'),\n",

During inhalation, the volume\\nof the thorax increases, largely through the contraction of the diaphragm, which moves downward and compresses\\nthe abdominal cavity. The elevation of the chest caused by the contraction of the external intercostal muscles also\\ncontributes to the increased volume of the thorax. The volume increase causes air pressure within the thorax to\\ndecrease, allowing us to inhale. Additionally, as air pressure within the thorax drops, blood pressure in the thoracic\\nveins also decreases, falling below the pressure in the abdominal veins. This causes blood to flow along its pressure\\ngradient from veins outside the thorax, where pressure is higher, into the thoracic region, where pressure is now\\nlower. This in turn promotes the return of blood from the thoracic veins to the atria. During exhalation, when air\\npressure increases within the thoracic cavity, pressure in the thoracic veins increases, speeding blood flow into the\\nheart while valves in the veins prevent blood from flowing backward from the thoracic and abdominal veins.\\nPressure Relationships in the Venous System\\nAlthough vessel diameter increases from the smaller venules to the larger veins and eventually to the venae cavae\\n(singular = vena cava), the total cross-sectional area actually decreases (see Figure 20.15a and b). The individual\\nveins are larger in diameter than the venules, but their total number is much lower, so their total cross-sectional\\narea is also lower.\\nAlso notice that, as blood moves from venules to veins, the average blood pressure drops (see Figure 20.15c), but\\nthe blood velocity actually increases (see Figure 20.15). This pressure gradient drives blood back toward the heart.\\nAgain, the presence of one-way valves and the skeletal muscle and respiratory pumps contribute to this increased\\nflow. Since approximately 64 percent of the total blood volume resides in systemic veins, any action that increases\\nthe flow of blood through the veins will increase venous return to the heart. Maintaining vascular tone within the\\nveins prevents the veins from merely distending, dampening the flow of blood, and as you will see, vasoconstriction\\nactually enhances the flow.\\nThe Role of Venoconstriction in Resistance, Blood Pressure, and Flow\\nAs previously discussed, vasoconstriction of an artery or arteriole decreases the radius, increasing resistance and\\npressure, but decreasing flow. Venoconstriction, on the other hand, has a very different outcome. The walls of veins\\nare thin but irregular; thus, when the smooth muscle in those walls constricts, the lumen becomes more rounded.\\nThe more rounded the lumen, the less surface area the blood encounters, and the less resistance the vessel offers.\\nVasoconstriction increases pressure within a vein as it does in an artery, but in veins, the increased pressure\\nincreases flow. Recall that the pressure in the atria, into which the venous blood will flow, is very low, approaching\\nzero for at least part of the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle. Thus, venoconstriction increases the return of\\nblood to the heart. Another way of stating this is that venoconstriction increases the preload or stretch of the cardiac\\nmuscle and increases contraction.\\n20.3 Capillary Exchange\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the primary mechanisms of capillary exchange\\n• Distinguish between capillary hydrostatic pressure and blood colloid osmotic pressure, explaining the\\ncontribution of each to net filtration pressure\\n• Compare filtration and reabsorption\\n• Explain the fate of fluid that is not reabsorbed from the tissues into the vascular capillaries\\nThe primary purpose of the cardiovascular system is to circulate gases, nutrients, wastes, and other substances to\\nand from the cells of the body.

Water moves by osmosis.\\nBulk Flow\\nThe mass movement of fluids into and out of capillary beds requires a transport mechanism far more efficient than\\nmere diffusion. This movement, often referred to as bulk flow, involves two pressure-driven mechanisms: Volumes\\nof fluid move from an area of higher pressure in a capillary bed to an area of lower pressure in the tissues via\\nfiltration. In contrast, the movement of fluid from an area of higher pressure in the tissues into an area of lower\\npressure in the capillaries is reabsorption. Two types of pressure interact to drive each of these movements:\\nhydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure.\\nHydrostatic Pressure\\nThe primary force driving fluid transport between the capillaries and tissues is hydrostatic pressure, which can be\\ndefined as the pressure of any fluid enclosed in a space. Blood hydrostatic pressure is the force exerted by the\\nblood confined within blood vessels or heart chambers. Even more specifically, the pressure exerted by blood\\nagainst the wall of a capillary is called capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP), and is the same as capillary blood\\npressure. CHP is the force that drives fluid out of capillaries and into the tissues.\\nAs fluid exits a capillary and moves into tissues, the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid correspondingly\\nrises. This opposing hydrostatic pressure is called the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (IFHP). Generally, the\\nCHP originating from the arterial pathways is considerably higher than the IFHP, because lymphatic vessels are\\ncontinually absorbing excess fluid from the tissues. Thus, fluid generally moves out of the capillary and into the\\ninterstitial fluid. This process is called filtration.\\nOsmotic Pressure\\nThe net pressure that drives reabsorption—the movement of fluid from the interstitial fluid back into the\\ncapillaries—is called osmotic pressure (sometimes referred to as oncotic pressure). Whereas hydrostatic pressure\\nforces fluid out of the capillary, osmotic pressure draws fluid back in. Osmotic pressure is determined by osmotic\\nconcentration gradients, that is, the difference in the solute-to-water concentrations in the blood and tissue fluid. A\\nregion higher in solute concentration (and lower in water concentration) draws water across a semipermeable\\nmembrane from a region higher in water concentration (and lower in solute concentration).\\nAs we discuss osmotic pressure in blood and tissue fluid, it is important to recognize that the formed elements of\\nblood do not contribute to osmotic concentration gradients. Rather, it is the plasma proteins that play the key role.\\nSolutes also move across the capillary wall according to their concentration gradient, but overall, the concentrations\\nshould be similar and not have a significant impact on osmosis. Because of their large size and chemical structure,\\nplasma proteins are not truly solutes, that is, they do not dissolve but are dispersed or suspended in their fluid\\nmedium, forming a colloid rather than a solution.\\nThe pressure created by the concentration of colloidal proteins in the blood is called the blood colloidal osmotic\\npressure (BCOP). Its effect on capillary exchange accounts for the reabsorption of water. The plasma proteins\\nsuspended in blood cannot move across the semipermeable capillary cell membrane, and so they remain in the\\nplasma. As a result, blood has a higher colloidal concentration and lower water concentration than tissue fluid. It\\ntherefore attracts water. We can also say that the BCOP is higher than the interstitial fluid colloidal osmotic\\npressure (IFCOP), which is always very low because interstitial fluid contains few proteins. Thus, water is drawn\\nfrom the tissue fluid back into the capillary, carrying dissolved molecules with it. This difference in colloidal osmotic\\npressure accounts for reabsorption.\\nInteraction of Hydrostatic and Osmotic Pressures\\nThe normal unit used to express pressures within the cardiovascular system is millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\\nWhen blood leaving an arteriole first enters a capillary bed, the CHP is quite high—about 35 mm Hg. Gradually, this\\ninitial CHP declines as the blood moves through the capillary so that by the time the blood has reached the venous\\nend, the CHP has dropped to approximately 18 mm Hg. In comparison, the plasma proteins remain suspended in\\nthe blood, so the BCOP remains fairly constant at about 25 mm Hg throughout the length of the capillary and\\nconsiderably above the osmotic pressure in the interstitial fluid.\\nThe net filtration pressure (NFP) represents the interaction of the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures, driving fluid\\n20.3 • Capillary Exchange 831'),\n",

It is equal to the difference between the CHP and the BCOP. Since filtration is, by definition, the\\nmovement of fluid out of the capillary, when reabsorption is occurring, the NFP is a negative number.\\nNFP changes at different points in a capillary bed (Figure 20.16). Close to the arterial end of the capillary, it is\\napproximately 10 mm Hg, because the CHP of 35 mm Hg minus the BCOP of 25 mm Hg equals 10 mm Hg. Recall\\nthat the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures of the interstitial fluid are essentially negligible. Thus, the NFP of 10 mm\\nHg drives a net movement of fluid out of the capillary at the arterial end. At approximately the middle of the\\ncapillary, the CHP is about the same as the BCOP of 25 mm Hg, so the NFP drops to zero. At this point, there is no\\nnet change of volume: Fluid moves out of the capillary at the same rate as it moves into the capillary. Near the\\nvenous end of the capillary, the CHP has dwindled to about 18 mm Hg due to loss of fluid. Because the BCOP\\nremains steady at 25 mm Hg, water is drawn into the capillary, that is, reabsorption occurs. Another way of\\nexpressing this is to say that at the venous end of the capillary, there is an NFP of −7 mm Hg.\\nFIGURE 20.16 Capillary Exchange Net filtration occurs near the arterial end of the capillary since capillary hydrostatic pressure (CHP)\\nis greater than blood colloidal osmotic pressure (BCOP). There is no net movement of fluid near the midpoint since CHP = BCOP. Net\\nreabsorption occurs near the venous end since BCOP is greater than CHP.\\nThe Role of Lymphatic Capillaries\\nSince overall CHP is higher than BCOP, it is inevitable that more net fluid will exit the capillary through filtration at\\nthe arterial end than enters through reabsorption at the venous end. Considering all capillaries over the course of a\\nday, this can be quite a substantial amount of fluid: Approximately 24 liters per day are filtered, whereas 20.4 liters\\nare reabsorbed. This excess fluid is picked up by capillaries of the lymphatic system. These extremely thin-walled\\nvessels have copious numbers of valves that ensure unidirectional flow through ever-larger lymphatic vessels that\\neventually drain into the subclavian veins in the neck. An important function of the lymphatic system is to return the\\nfluid (lymph) to the blood. Lymph may be thought of as recycled blood plasma.

Changes in\\ndiameter affect peripheral resistance, pressure, and flow, which affect cardiac output. The majority of these\\nneurons act via the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons.\\nAlthough each center functions independently, they are not anatomically distinct.\\nThere is also a small population of neurons that control vasodilation in the vessels of the brain and skeletal muscles\\nby relaxing the smooth muscle fibers in the vessel tunics. Many of these are cholinergic neurons, that is, they\\nrelease acetylcholine, which in turn stimulates the vessels’ endothelial cells to release nitric oxide (NO), which\\ncauses vasodilation. Others release norepinephrine that binds to β2 receptors. A few neurons release NO directly as\\na neurotransmitter.\\nRecall that mild stimulation of the skeletal muscles maintains muscle tone. A similar phenomenon occurs with\\nvascular tone in vessels. As noted earlier, arterioles are normally partially constricted: With maximal stimulation,\\ntheir radius may be reduced to one-half of the resting state. Full dilation of most arterioles requires that this\\nsympathetic stimulation be suppressed. When it is, an arteriole can expand by as much as 150 percent. Such a\\nsignificant increase can dramatically affect resistance, pressure, and flow.\\nBaroreceptor Reflexes\\nBaroreceptors are specialized stretch receptors located within thin areas of blood vessels and heart chambers that\\nrespond to the degree of stretch caused by the presence of blood. They send impulses to the cardiovascular center\\nto regulate blood pressure. Vascular baroreceptors are found primarily in sinuses (small cavities) within the aorta\\nand carotid arteries: The aortic sinuses are found in the walls of the ascending aorta just superior to the aortic\\nvalve, whereas the carotid sinuses are in the base of the internal carotid arteries. There are also low-pressure\\nbaroreceptors located in the walls of the venae cavae and right atrium.\\nWhen blood pressure increases, the baroreceptors are stretched more tightly and initiate action potentials at a\\nhigher rate. At lower blood pressures, the degree of stretch is lower and the rate of firing is slower. When the\\ncardiovascular center in the medulla oblongata receives this input, it triggers a reflex that maintains homeostasis\\n(Figure 20.18):\\n• When blood pressure rises too high, the baroreceptors fire at a higher rate and trigger parasympathetic\\nstimulation of the heart. As a result, cardiac output falls. Sympathetic stimulation of the peripheral arterioles\\nwill also decrease, resulting in vasodilation.

Normally, blood flow into the aorta is the same as blood flow back into the right atrium. If\\nblood is returning to the right atrium more rapidly than it is being ejected from the left ventricle, the atrial receptors\\nwill stimulate the cardiovascular centers to increase sympathetic firing and increase cardiac output until\\nhomeostasis is achieved. The opposite is also true. This mechanism is referred to as the atrial reflex.\\nChemoreceptor Reflexes\\nIn addition to the baroreceptors are chemoreceptors that monitor levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen\\nions (pH), and thereby contribute to vascular homeostasis. Chemoreceptors monitoring the blood are located in\\nclose proximity to the baroreceptors in the aortic and carotid sinuses. They signal the cardiovascular center as well\\nas the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata.\\nSince tissues consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide and acids as waste products, when the body is more\\nactive, oxygen levels fall and carbon dioxide levels rise as cells undergo cellular respiration to meet the energy\\nneeds of activities. This causes more hydrogen ions to be produced, causing the blood pH to drop. When the body is\\nresting, oxygen levels are higher, carbon dioxide levels are lower, more hydrogen is bound, and pH rises. (Seek\\nadditional content for more detail about pH.)\\nThe chemoreceptors respond to increasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ion levels (falling pH) by stimulating the\\ncardioaccelerator and vasomotor centers, increasing cardiac output and constricting peripheral vessels.

This interrelationship of cardiovascular and respiratory control cannot be\\noveremphasized.\\nOther neural mechanisms can also have a significant impact on cardiovascular function.

They increase heart rate and force of\\ncontraction, while temporarily constricting blood vessels to organs not essential for flight-or-fight responses and\\nredirecting blood flow to the liver, muscles, and heart.\\nAntidiuretic Hormone\\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is secreted by the cells in the hypothalamus and\\ntransported via the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tracts to the posterior pituitary where it is stored until released upon\\nnervous stimulation. The primary trigger prompting the hypothalamus to release ADH is increasing osmolarity of\\ntissue fluid, usually in response to significant loss of blood volume. ADH signals its target cells in the kidneys to\\nreabsorb more water, thus preventing the loss of additional fluid in the urine. This will increase overall fluid levels\\nand help restore blood volume and pressure. In addition, ADH constricts peripheral vessels.\\nRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Mechanism\\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism has a major effect upon the cardiovascular system (Figure 20.19).\\nRenin is an enzyme, although because of its importance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, some\\nsources identify it as a hormone. Specialized cells in the kidneys , called juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, respond to\\ndecreased blood pressure by secreting renin into the blood. Renin converts the plasma protein angiotensinogen,\\nwhich is produced by the liver, into its active form—angiotensin I. Angiotensin I circulates in the blood and is then\\nconverted into angiotensin II in the lungs. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme\\n(ACE).\\nAngiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, greatly increasing blood pressure. It also stimulates the release of ADH\\nand aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium into\\nthe blood by the kidneys. Since water follows sodium, this increases the reabsorption of water. This in turn increases\\nblood volume, raising blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, so an\\nindividual will likely consume more fluids, again increasing blood volume and pressure.\\nFIGURE 20.19 Hormones Involved in Renal Control of Blood Pressure In the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism, increasing\\nangiotensin II will stimulate the production of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone. In addition to renin, the kidneys produce\\nerythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells, further increasing blood volume.\\nErythropoietin\\nErythropoietin (EPO) is released by the kidneys when blood flow and/or oxygen levels decrease.

Erythrocytes are the major formed element of the blood and\\nmay contribute 40 percent or more to blood volume, a significant factor of viscosity, resistance, pressure, and flow.\\nIn addition, EPO is a vasoconstrictor. Overproduction of EPO or excessive intake of synthetic EPO, often to enhance\\nathletic performance, will increase viscosity, resistance, and pressure, and decrease flow in addition to its\\ncontribution as a vasoconstrictor.\\nAtrial Natriuretic Hormone\\nSecreted by cells in the atria of the heart, atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) (also known as atrial natriuretic peptide)\\nis secreted when blood volume is high enough to cause extreme stretching of the cardiac cells. Cells in the ventricle\\nproduce a hormone with similar effects, called B-type natriuretic hormone. Natriuretic hormones are antagonists to\\nangiotensin II. They promote loss of sodium and water from the kidneys, and suppress renin, aldosterone, and ADH\\nproduction and release. All of these actions promote loss of fluid from the body, so blood volume and blood\\npressure drop.\\nAutoregulation of Perfusion\\nAs the name would suggest, autoregulation mechanisms require neither specialized nervous stimulation nor\\nendocrine control. Rather, these are local, self-regulatory mechanisms that allow each region of tissue to adjust its\\nblood flow—and thus its perfusion. These local mechanisms include chemical signals and myogenic controls.\\nChemical Signals Involved in Autoregulation\\nChemical signals work at the level of the precapillary sphincters to trigger either constriction or relaxation. As you\\nknow, opening a precapillary sphincter allows blood to flow into that particular capillary, whereas constricting a\\nprecapillary sphincter temporarily shuts off blood flow to that region. The factors involved in regulating the\\nprecapillary sphincters include the following:\\n• Opening of the sphincter is triggered in response to decreased oxygen concentrations; increased carbon dioxide\\nconcentrations; increasing levels of lactic acid or other byproducts of cellular metabolism; increasing\\nconcentrations of potassium ions or hydrogen ions (falling pH); inflammatory chemicals such as histamines; and\\nincreased body temperature. These conditions in turn stimulate the release of NO, a powerful vasodilator, from\\nendothelial cells (see Figure 20.17).\\n• Contraction of the precapillary sphincter is triggered by the opposite levels of the regulators, which prompt the\\nrelease of endothelins, powerful vasoconstricting peptides secreted by endothelial cells. Platelet secretions\\nand certain prostaglandins may also trigger constriction.\\nAgain, these factors alter tissue perfusion via their effects on the precapillary sphincter mechanism, which regulates\\nblood flow to capillaries. Since the amount of blood is limited, not all capillaries can fill at once, so blood flow is\\nallocated based upon the needs and metabolic state of the tissues as reflected in these parameters. Bear in mind,\\nhowever, that dilation and constriction of the arterioles feeding the capillary beds is the primary control mechanism.\\nThe Myogenic Response\\nThe myogenic response is a reaction to the stretching of the smooth muscle in the walls of arterioles as changes in\\nblood flow occur through the vessel. This may be viewed as a largely protective function against dramatic\\nfluctuations in blood pressure and blood flow to maintain homeostasis. If perfusion of an organ is too low\\n(ischemia), the tissue will experience low levels of oxygen (hypoxia). In contrast, excessive perfusion could damage\\nthe organ’s smaller and more fragile vessels. The myogenic response is a localized process that serves to stabilize\\nblood flow in the capillary network that follows that arteriole.\\nWhen blood flow is low, the vessel’s smooth muscle will be only minimally stretched. In response, it relaxes,\\nallowing the vessel to dilate and thereby increase the movement of blood into the tissue. When blood flow is too\\nhigh, the smooth muscle will contract in response to the increased stretch, prompting vasoconstriction that reduces\\nblood flow.\\nFigure 20.20 summarizes the effects of nervous, endocrine, and local controls on arterioles.\\n838 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

For a healthy young adult, cardiac\\noutput (heart rate × stroke volume) increases in the nonathlete from approximately 5.0 liters (5.25 quarts) per\\nminute to a maximum of about 20 liters (21 quarts) per minute. Accompanying this will be an increase in blood\\npressure from about 120/80 to 185/75. However, well-trained aerobic athletes can increase these values\\nsubstantially. For these individuals, cardiac output soars from approximately 5.3 liters (5.57 quarts) per minute\\nresting to more than 30 liters (31.5 quarts) per minute during maximal exercise. Along with this increase in cardiac\\noutput, blood pressure increases from 120/80 at rest to 200/90 at maximum values.\\nIn addition to improved cardiac function, exercise increases the size and mass of the heart. The average weight of\\nthe heart for the nonathlete is about 300 g, whereas in an athlete it will increase to 500 g. This increase in size\\ngenerally makes the heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, increasing both stroke volume and cardiac\\noutput.\\nTissue perfusion also increases as the body transitions from a resting state to light exercise and eventually to heavy\\n20.4 • Homeostatic Regulation of the Vascular System 839'),\n",

These changes result in selective vasodilation in the skeletal muscles, heart, lungs,\\nliver, and integument. Simultaneously, vasoconstriction occurs in the vessels leading to the kidneys and most of the\\ndigestive and reproductive organs. The flow of blood to the brain remains largely unchanged whether at rest or\\nexercising, since the vessels in the brain largely do not respond to regulatory stimuli, in most cases, because they\\nlack the appropriate receptors.\\nAs vasodilation occurs in selected vessels, resistance drops and more blood rushes into the organs they supply. This\\nblood eventually returns to the venous system. Venous return is further enhanced by both the skeletal muscle and\\nrespiratory pumps. As blood returns to the heart more quickly, preload rises and the Frank-Starling principle tells us\\nthat contraction of the cardiac muscle in the atria and ventricles will be more forceful. Eventually, even the best-\\ntrained athletes will fatigue and must undergo a period of rest following exercise. Cardiac output and distribution of\\nblood then return to normal.\\nRegular exercise promotes cardiovascular health in a variety of ways. Because an athlete’s heart is larger than a\\nnonathlete’s, stroke volume increases, so the athletic heart can deliver the same amount of blood as the nonathletic\\nheart but with a lower heart rate. This increased efficiency allows the athlete to exercise for longer periods of time\\nbefore muscles fatigue and places less stress on the heart. Exercise also lowers overall cholesterol levels by\\nremoving from the circulation a complex form of cholesterol, triglycerides, and proteins known as low-density\\nlipoproteins (LDLs), which are widely associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although there is no\\nway to remove deposits of plaque from the walls of arteries other than specialized surgery, exercise does promote\\nthe health of vessels by decreasing the rate of plaque formation and reducing blood pressure, so the heart does not\\nhave to generate as much force to overcome resistance.\\nGenerally as little as 30 minutes of noncontinuous exercise over the course of each day has beneficial effects and\\nhas been shown to lower the rate of heart attack by nearly 50 percent. While it is always advisable to follow a\\nhealthy diet, stop smoking, and lose weight, studies have clearly shown that fit, overweight people may actually be\\nhealthier overall than sedentary slender people. Thus, the benefits of moderate exercise are undeniable.\\nClinical Considerations in Vascular Homeostasis\\nAny disorder that affects blood volume, vascular tone, or any other aspect of vascular functioning is likely to affect\\nvascular homeostasis as well. That includes hypertension, hemorrhage, and shock.\\nHypertension and Hypotension\\nNew guidelines in 2017 from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association list normal blood\\npressure (BP) as less than 120/80 mm Hg and elevated BP as systolic P between 120–129 and diastolic P less than\\n80 mm Hg. Chronically elevated blood pressure is known clinically as hypertension. The new guidelines list\\nhypertension that should be treated as 130/80 mm Hg. Tens of millions of Americans currently suffer from\\nhypertension. Unfortunately, hypertension is typically a silent disorder; therefore, hypertensive patients may fail to\\nrecognize the seriousness of their condition and fail to follow their treatment plan. The result is often a heart attack\\nor stroke. Hypertension may also lead to an aneurysm (ballooning of a blood vessel caused by a weakening of the\\nwall), peripheral arterial disease (obstruction of vessels in peripheral regions of the body), chronic kidney disease, or\\nheart failure.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nListen to this CDC podcast (http://openstax.org/l/CDCpodcast) to learn about hypertension, often described as a\\n“silent killer.” What steps can you take to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke?\\nHemorrhage\\nMinor blood loss is managed by hemostasis and repair. Hemorrhage is a loss of blood that cannot be controlled by\\nhemostatic mechanisms. Initially, the body responds to hemorrhage by initiating mechanisms aimed at increasing\\nblood pressure and maintaining blood flow. Ultimately, however, blood volume will need to be restored, either\\nthrough physiological processes or through medical intervention.\\nIn response to blood loss, stimuli from the baroreceptors trigger the cardiovascular centers to stimulate\\nsympathetic responses to increase cardiac output and vasoconstriction.

Vasoconstriction of\\nthe arterioles increases vascular resistance, whereas constriction of the veins increases venous return to the heart.\\nBoth of these steps will help increase blood pressure. Sympathetic stimulation also triggers the release of\\nepinephrine and norepinephrine, which enhance both cardiac output and vasoconstriction. If blood loss were less\\nthan 20 percent of total blood volume, these responses together would usually return blood pressure to normal and\\nredirect the remaining blood to the tissues.\\nAdditional endocrine involvement is necessary, however, to restore the lost blood volume. The angiotensin-renin-\\naldosterone mechanism stimulates the thirst center in the hypothalamus, which increases fluid consumption to help\\nrestore the lost blood. More importantly, it increases renal reabsorption of sodium and water, reducing water loss in\\nurine output. The kidneys also increase the production of EPO, stimulating the formation of erythrocytes that not\\nonly deliver oxygen to the tissues but also increase overall blood volume. Figure 20.21 summarizes the responses to\\nloss of blood volume.\\nFIGURE 20.21 Homeostatic Responses to Loss of Blood Volume\\nCirculatory Shock\\nThe loss of too much blood may lead to circulatory shock, a life-threatening condition in which the circulatory\\nsystem is unable to maintain blood flow to adequately supply sufficient oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues to\\nmaintain cellular metabolism. It should not be confused with emotional or psychological shock. Typically, the\\npatient in circulatory shock will demonstrate an increased heart rate but decreased blood pressure, but there are\\ncases in which blood pressure will remain normal. Urine output will fall dramatically, and the patient may appear\\nconfused or lose consciousness. Urine output less than 1 mL/kg body weight/hour is cause for concern.\\nUnfortunately, shock is an example of a positive-feedback loop that, if uncorrected, may lead to the death of the\\npatient.\\nThere are several recognized forms of shock:\\n• Hypovolemic shock in adults is typically caused by hemorrhage, although in children it may be caused by fluid\\nlosses related to severe vomiting or diarrhea. Other causes for hypovolemic shock include extensive burns,\\nexposure to some toxins, and excessive urine loss related to diabetes insipidus or ketoacidosis. Typically,\\npatients present with a rapid, almost tachycardic heart rate; a weak pulse often described as “thready;” cool,\\nclammy skin, particularly in the extremities, due to restricted peripheral blood flow; rapid, shallow breathing;\\nhypothermia; thirst; and dry mouth. Treatments generally involve providing intravenous fluids to restore the\\npatient to normal function and various drugs such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine to raise blood\\npressure.\\n• Cardiogenic shock results from the inability of the heart to maintain cardiac output. Most often, it results from\\na myocardial infarction (heart attack), but it may also be caused by arrhythmias, valve disorders,\\ncardiomyopathies, cardiac failure, or simply insufficient flow of blood through the cardiac vessels.

It may arise\\nfrom a variety of causes, and treatments almost always involve fluid replacement and medications, called\\ninotropic or pressor agents, which restore tone to the muscles of the vessels. In addition, eliminating or at least\\nalleviating the underlying cause of the condition is required. This might include antibiotics and antihistamines,\\nor select steroids, which may aid in the repair of nerve damage. A common cause is sepsis (or septicemia), also\\ncalled “blood poisoning,” which is a widespread bacterial infection that results in an organismal-level\\ninflammatory response known as septic shock. Neurogenic shock is a form of vascular shock that occurs with\\ncranial or spinal injuries that damage the cardiovascular centers in the medulla oblongata or the nervous fibers\\noriginating from this region. Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic response that causes the widespread\\nrelease of histamines, triggering vasodilation throughout the body.\\n• Obstructive shock, as the name would suggest, occurs when a significant portion of the vascular system is\\nblocked. It is not always recognized as a distinct condition and may be grouped with cardiogenic shock,\\nincluding pulmonary embolism and cardiac tamponade. Treatments depend upon the underlying cause and, in\\naddition to administering fluids intravenously, often include the administration of anticoagulants, removal of\\nfluid from the pericardial cavity, or air from the thoracic cavity, and surgery as required. The most common\\ncause is a pulmonary embolism, a clot that lodges in the pulmonary vessels and interrupts blood flow. Other\\ncauses include stenosis of the aortic valve; cardiac tamponade, in which excess fluid in the pericardial cavity\\ninterferes with the ability of the heart to fully relax and fill with blood (resulting in decreased preload); and a\\npneumothorax, in which an excessive amount of air is present in the thoracic cavity, outside of the lungs, which\\ninterferes with venous return, pulmonary function, and delivery of oxygen to the tissues.\\n20.5 Circulatory Pathways\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the vessels through which blood travels within the pulmonary circuit, beginning from the right ventricle\\nof the heart and ending at the left atrium\\n• Create a flow chart showing the major systemic arteries through which blood travels from the aorta and its\\nmajor branches, to the most significant arteries feeding into the right and left upper and lower limbs\\n• Create a flow chart showing the major systemic veins through which blood travels from the feet to the right\\natrium of the heart\\nVirtually every cell, tissue, organ, and system in the body is impacted by the circulatory system. This includes the\\ngeneralized and more specialized functions of transport of materials, capillary exchange, maintaining health by\\ntransporting white blood cells and various immunoglobulins (antibodies), hemostasis, regulation of body\\ntemperature, and helping to maintain acid-base balance.

Where differences occur in branching\\npatterns or when vessels are singular, this will be indicated. For example, you will find a pair of femoral arteries and\\na pair of femoral veins, with one vessel on each side of the body. In contrast, some vessels closer to the midline of\\nthe body, such as the aorta, are unique. Moreover, some superficial veins, such as the great saphenous vein in the\\nfemoral region, have no arterial counterpart. Another phenomenon that can make the study of vessels challenging is\\nthat names of vessels can change with location.

These vessels will\\nbe described more fully later in this section. This blood is relatively low in oxygen and relatively high in carbon\\ndioxide, since much of the oxygen has been extracted for use by the tissues and the waste gas carbon dioxide was\\npicked up to be transported to the lungs for elimination. From the right atrium, blood moves into the right ventricle,\\nwhich pumps it to the lungs for gas exchange. This system of vessels is referred to as the pulmonary circuit.\\nThe single vessel exiting the right ventricle is the pulmonary trunk. At the base of the pulmonary trunk is the\\npulmonary semilunar valve, which prevents backflow of blood into the right ventricle during ventricular diastole. As\\nthe pulmonary trunk reaches the superior surface of the heart, it curves posteriorly and rapidly bifurcates (divides)\\ninto two branches, a left and a right pulmonary artery. To prevent confusion between these vessels, it is important\\nto refer to the vessel exiting the heart as the pulmonary trunk, rather than also calling it a pulmonary artery. The\\npulmonary arteries in turn branch many times within the lung, forming a series of smaller arteries and arterioles that\\neventually lead to the pulmonary capillaries. The pulmonary capillaries surround lung structures known as alveoli\\nthat are the sites of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.\\nOnce gas exchange is completed, oxygenated blood flows from the pulmonary capillaries into a series of pulmonary\\nvenules that eventually lead to a series of larger pulmonary veins.

These sinuses\\ncontain the aortic baroreceptors and chemoreceptors critical to maintain cardiac function. The left coronary artery\\narises from the left posterior aortic sinus. The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus. Normally,\\nthe right posterior aortic sinus does not give rise to a vessel.\\nThe coronary arteries encircle the heart, forming a ring-like structure that divides into the next level of branches that\\nsupplies blood to the heart tissues. (Seek additional content for more detail on cardiac circulation.)\\nAortic Arch Branches\\nThere are three major branches of the aortic arch: the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery, and\\nthe left subclavian (literally “under the clavicle”) artery. As you would expect based upon proximity to the heart,\\neach of these vessels is classified as an elastic artery.\\nThe brachiocephalic artery is located only on the right side of the body; there is no corresponding artery on the left.\\nThe brachiocephalic artery branches into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery. The left\\nsubclavian and left common carotid arteries arise independently from the aortic arch but otherwise follow a similar\\npattern and distribution to the corresponding arteries on the right side (see Figure 20.23).\\nEach subclavian artery supplies blood to the arms, chest, shoulders, back, and central nervous system. It then\\ngives rise to three major branches: the internal thoracic artery, the vertebral artery, and the thyrocervical artery. The\\ninternal thoracic artery, or mammary artery, supplies blood to the thymus, the pericardium of the heart, and the\\nanterior chest wall. The vertebral artery passes through the vertebral foramen in the cervical vertebrae and then\\nthrough the foramen magnum into the cranial cavity to supply blood to the brain and spinal cord. The paired\\nvertebral arteries join together to form the large basilar artery at the base of the medulla oblongata. This is an\\nexample of an anastomosis. The subclavian artery also gives rise to the thyrocervical artery that provides blood to\\nthe thyroid, the cervical region of the neck, and the upper back and shoulder.\\nThe common carotid artery divides into internal and external carotid arteries. The right common carotid artery\\narises from the brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery arises directly from the aortic arch. The\\nexternal carotid artery supplies blood to numerous structures within the face, lower jaw, neck, esophagus, and\\nlarynx. These branches include the lingual, facial, occipital, maxillary, and superficial temporal arteries. The internal\\ncarotid artery initially forms an expansion known as the carotid sinus, containing the carotid baroreceptors and\\nchemoreceptors. Like their counterparts in the aortic sinuses, the information provided by these receptors is critical\\nto maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (see Figure 20.23).\\nThe internal carotid arteries along with the vertebral arteries are the two primary suppliers of blood to the human\\nbrain. Given the central role and vital importance of the brain to life, it is critical that blood supply to this organ\\nremains uninterrupted. Recall that blood flow to the brain is remarkably constant, with approximately 20 percent of\\nblood flow directed to this organ at any given time. When blood flow is interrupted, even for just a few seconds, a\\ntransient ischemic attack (TIA), or mini-stroke, may occur, resulting in loss of consciousness or temporary loss of\\nneurological function. In some cases, the damage may be permanent. Loss of blood flow for longer periods, typically\\nbetween 3 and 4 minutes, will likely produce irreversible brain damage or a stroke, also called a cerebrovascular\\naccident (CVA). The locations of the arteries in the brain not only provide blood flow to the brain tissue but also\\nprevent interruption in the flow of blood. Both the carotid and vertebral arteries branch once they enter the cranial\\n848 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

As a rule, branches to the anterior portion of the cerebrum are normally fed by the internal carotid arteries;\\nthe remainder of the brain receives blood flow from branches associated with the vertebral arteries.\\nThe internal carotid artery continues through the carotid canal of the temporal bone and enters the base of the brain\\nthrough the carotid foramen where it gives rise to several branches (Figure 20.26 and Figure 20.27). One of these\\nbranches is the anterior cerebral artery that supplies blood to the frontal lobe of the cerebrum. Another branch, the\\nmiddle cerebral artery, supplies blood to the temporal and parietal lobes, which are the most common sites of\\nCVAs. The ophthalmic artery, the third major branch, provides blood to the eyes.\\nThe right and left anterior cerebral arteries join together to form an anastomosis called the anterior communicating\\nartery. The initial segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and the anterior communicating artery form the anterior\\nportion of the arterial circle. The posterior portion of the arterial circle is formed by a left and a right posterior\\ncommunicating artery that branches from the posterior cerebral artery, which arises from the basilar artery. It\\nprovides blood to the posterior portion of the cerebrum and brain stem. The basilar artery is an anastomosis that\\nbegins at the junction of the two vertebral arteries and sends branches to the cerebellum and brain stem. It flows\\ninto the posterior cerebral arteries. Table 20.6 summarizes the aortic arch branches, including the major branches\\nsupplying the brain.\\nFIGURE 20.26 Arteries Supplying the Head and Neck The common carotid artery gives rise to the external and internal carotid\\narteries.

Those branches that supply blood primarily to visceral organs are known as the visceral\\nbranches and include the bronchial arteries, pericardial arteries, esophageal arteries, and the mediastinal arteries,\\neach named after the tissues it supplies. Each bronchial artery (typically two on the left and one on the right)\\nsupplies systemic blood to the lungs and visceral pleura, in addition to the blood pumped to the lungs for\\noxygenation via the pulmonary circuit. The bronchial arteries follow the same path as the respiratory branches,\\nbeginning with the bronchi and ending with the bronchioles. There is considerable, but not total, intermingling of the\\nsystemic and pulmonary blood at anastomoses in the smaller branches of the lungs. This may sound\\nincongruous—that is, the mixing of systemic arterial blood high in oxygen with the pulmonary arterial blood lower in\\noxygen—but the systemic vessels also deliver nutrients to the lung tissue just as they do elsewhere in the body. The\\nmixed blood drains into typical pulmonary veins, whereas the bronchial artery branches remain separate and drain\\ninto bronchial veins described later.

This vessel remains to the left of the vertebral column and is embedded in adipose tissue behind the\\nperitoneal cavity. It formally ends at approximately the level of vertebra L4, where it bifurcates to form the common\\niliac arteries. Before this division, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several important branches. A single celiac\\ntrunk (artery) emerges and divides into the left gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach and esophagus, the\\nsplenic artery to supply blood to the spleen, and the common hepatic artery, which in turn gives rise to the\\nhepatic artery proper to supply blood to the liver, the right gastric artery to supply blood to the stomach, the\\ncystic artery to supply blood to the gall bladder, and several branches, one to supply blood to the duodenum and\\nanother to supply blood to the pancreas. Two additional single vessels arise from the abdominal aorta. These are\\nthe superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The superior mesenteric artery arises approximately 2.5 cm after the\\nceliac trunk and branches into several major vessels that supply blood to the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum,\\nand ileum), the pancreas, and a majority of the large intestine. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies blood to the\\ndistal segment of the large intestine, including the rectum. It arises approximately 5 cm superior to the common\\niliac arteries.\\nIn addition to these single branches, the abdominal aorta gives rise to several significant paired arteries along the\\nway. These include the inferior phrenic arteries, the adrenal arteries, the renal arteries, the gonadal arteries, and the\\nlumbar arteries. Each inferior phrenic artery is a counterpart of a superior phrenic artery and supplies blood to the\\ninferior surface of the diaphragm. The adrenal artery supplies blood to the adrenal (suprarenal) glands and arises\\nnear the superior mesenteric artery. Each renal artery branches approximately 2.5 cm inferior to the superior\\nmesenteric arteries and supplies a kidney. The right renal artery is longer than the left since the aorta lies to the left\\nof the vertebral column and the vessel must travel a greater distance to reach its target. Renal arteries branch\\nrepeatedly to supply blood to the kidneys. Each gonadal artery supplies blood to the gonads, or reproductive\\norgans, and is also described as either an ovarian artery or a testicular artery (internal spermatic), depending upon\\nthe sex of the individual. An ovarian artery supplies blood to an ovary, uterine (Fallopian) tube, and the uterus, and\\nis located within the suspensory ligament of the uterus. It is considerably shorter than a testicular artery, which\\nultimately travels outside the body cavity to the testes, forming one component of the spermatic cord. The gonadal\\narteries arise inferior to the renal arteries and are generally retroperitoneal. The ovarian artery continues to the\\nuterus where it forms an anastomosis with the uterine artery that supplies blood to the uterus. Both the uterine\\narteries and vaginal arteries, which distribute blood to the vagina, are branches of the internal iliac artery. The four\\npaired lumbar arteries are the counterparts of the intercostal arteries and supply blood to the lumbar region, the\\nabdominal wall, and the spinal cord. In some instances, a fifth pair of lumbar arteries emerges from the median\\nsacral artery.\\nThe aorta divides at approximately the level of vertebra L4 into a left and a right common iliac artery but continues\\nas a small vessel, the median sacral artery, into the sacrum. The common iliac arteries provide blood to the pelvic\\nregion and ultimately to the lower limbs. They split into external and internal iliac arteries approximately at the level\\nof the lumbar-sacral articulation. Each internal iliac artery sends branches to the urinary bladder, the walls of the\\npelvis, the external genitalia, and the medial portion of the femoral region.

Since the blood has already passed through the systemic capillaries,\\nit will be relatively low in oxygen concentration. In many cases, there will be veins draining organs and regions of the\\nbody with the same name as the arteries that supplied these regions and the two often parallel one another. This is\\noften described as a “complementary” pattern. However, there is a great deal more variability in the venous\\ncirculation than normally occurs in the arteries. For the sake of brevity and clarity, this text will discuss only the most\\ncommonly encountered patterns. However, keep this variation in mind when you move from the classroom to\\nclinical practice.\\nIn both the neck and limb regions, there are often both superficial and deeper levels of veins. The deeper veins\\ngenerally correspond to the complementary arteries. The superficial veins do not normally have direct arterial\\ncounterparts, but in addition to returning blood, they also make contributions to the maintenance of body\\ntemperature. When the ambient temperature is warm, more blood is diverted to the superficial veins where heat can\\nbe more easily dissipated to the environment. In colder weather, there is more constriction of the superficial veins\\nand blood is diverted deeper where the body can retain more of the heat.\\n862 20 • The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Most reabsorption of\\ncerebrospinal fluid occurs via the chorionic villi (arachnoid granulations) into the superior sagittal sinus. Blood from\\nmost of the smaller vessels originating from the inferior cerebral veins flows into the great cerebral vein and into\\nthe straight sinus. Other cerebral veins and those from the eye socket flow into the cavernous sinus, which flows\\ninto the petrosal sinus and then into the internal jugular vein.

Lying just beneath\\nthe parietal peritoneum in the abdominal cavity, the inferior vena cava parallels the abdominal aorta, where it can\\nreceive blood from abdominal veins. The lumbar portions of the abdominal wall and spinal cord are drained by a\\nseries of lumbar veins, usually four on each side. The ascending lumbar veins drain into either the azygos vein on\\nthe right or the hemiazygos vein on the left, and return to the superior vena cava. The remaining lumbar veins drain\\ndirectly into the inferior vena cava.\\nBlood supply from the kidneys flows into each renal vein, normally the largest veins entering the inferior vena cava.\\nA number of other, smaller veins empty into the left renal vein. Each adrenal vein drains the adrenal or suprarenal\\nglands located immediately superior to the kidneys. The right adrenal vein enters the inferior vena cava directly,\\nwhereas the left adrenal vein enters the left renal vein.\\nFrom the male reproductive organs, each testicular vein flows from the scrotum, forming a portion of the spermatic\\ncord. Each ovarian vein drains an ovary in females. Each of these veins is generically called a gonadal vein. The\\nright gonadal vein empties directly into the inferior vena cava, and the left gonadal vein empties into the left renal\\nvein.\\nEach side of the diaphragm drains into a phrenic vein; the right phrenic vein empties directly into the inferior vena\\ncava, whereas the left phrenic vein empties into the left renal vein. Blood supply from the liver drains into each\\nhepatic vein and directly into the inferior vena cava. Since the inferior vena cava lies primarily to the right of the\\nvertebral column and aorta, the left renal vein is longer, as are the left phrenic, adrenal, and gonadal veins. The\\nlonger length of the left renal vein makes the left kidney the primary target of surgeons removing this organ for\\ndonation.

From the dorsal venous arch, blood supply drains into the anterior and\\nposterior tibial veins. The anterior tibial vein drains the area near the tibialis anterior muscle and combines with the\\nposterior tibial vein and the fibular vein to form the popliteal vein. The posterior tibial vein drains the posterior\\nsurface of the tibia and joins the popliteal vein. The fibular vein drains the muscles and integument in proximity to\\nthe fibula and also joins the popliteal vein. The small saphenous vein located on the lateral surface of the leg drains\\nblood from the superficial regions of the lower leg and foot, and flows into to the popliteal vein. As the popliteal\\nvein passes behind the knee in the popliteal region, it becomes the femoral vein. It is palpable in patients without\\nexcessive adipose tissue.\\nClose to the body wall, the great saphenous vein, the deep femoral vein, and the femoral circumflex vein drain into\\nthe femoral vein. The great saphenous vein is a prominent surface vessel located on the medial surface of the leg\\nand thigh that collects blood from the superficial portions of these areas. The deep femoral vein, as the name\\nsuggests, drains blood from the deeper portions of the thigh. The femoral circumflex vein forms a loop around the\\nfemur just inferior to the trochanters and drains blood from the areas in proximity to the head and neck of the femur.\\nAs the femoral vein penetrates the body wall from the femoral portion of the upper limb, it becomes the external\\niliac vein, a large vein that drains blood from the leg to the common iliac vein. The pelvic organs and integument\\ndrain into the internal iliac vein, which forms from several smaller veins in the region, including the umbilical veins\\nthat run on either side of the bladder. The external and internal iliac veins combine near the inferior portion of the\\nsacroiliac joint to form the common iliac vein. In addition to blood supply from the external and internal iliac veins,\\nthe middle sacral vein drains the sacral region into the common iliac vein.

You saw the only other portal system with the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessel in the endocrine\\nchapter.\\nThe hepatic portal system consists of the hepatic portal vein and the veins that drain into it. The hepatic portal vein\\nitself is relatively short, beginning at the level of L2 with the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins.\\nIt also receives branches from the inferior mesenteric vein, plus the splenic veins and all their tributaries. The\\nsuperior mesenteric vein receives blood from the small intestine, two-thirds of the large intestine, and the stomach.\\nThe inferior mesenteric vein drains the distal third of the large intestine, including the descending colon, the sigmoid\\ncolon, and the rectum. The splenic vein is formed from branches from the spleen, pancreas, and portions of the\\nstomach, and the inferior mesenteric vein. After its formation, the hepatic portal vein also receives branches from\\nthe gastric veins of the stomach and cystic veins from the gall bladder. The hepatic portal vein delivers materials\\nfrom these digestive and circulatory organs directly to the liver for processing.\\nBecause of the hepatic portal system, the liver receives its blood supply from two different sources: from normal\\nsystemic circulation via the hepatic artery and from the hepatic portal vein. The liver processes the blood from the\\nportal system to remove certain wastes and excess nutrients, which are stored for later use. This processed blood,\\nas well as the systemic blood that came from the hepatic artery, exits the liver via the right, left, and middle hepatic\\nveins, and flows into the inferior vena cava. Overall systemic blood composition remains relatively stable, since the\\nliver is able to metabolize the absorbed digestive components.\\nFIGURE 20.43 Hepatic Portal System The liver receives blood from the normal systemic circulation via the hepatic artery. It also\\nreceives and processes blood from other organs, delivered via the veins of the hepatic portal system. All blood exits the liver via the hepatic\\nvein, which delivers the blood to the inferior vena cava.

Circulation\\npatterns are clearly established by the fourth week of embryonic life. It is critical to the survival of the developing\\nhuman that the circulatory system forms early to supply the growing tissue with nutrients and gases, and to remove\\nwaste products. Blood cells and vessel production in structures outside the embryo proper called the yolk sac,\\nchorion, and connecting stalk begin about 15 to 16 days following fertilization. Development of these circulatory\\nelements within the embryo itself begins approximately 2 days later.

During those first few weeks, blood\\nvessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm. The precursor cells are known as hemangioblasts. These in\\nturn differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells, which\\ndifferentiate into the formed elements of blood. (Seek additional content for more detail on fetal development and\\ncirculation.) Together, these cells form masses known as blood islands scattered throughout the embryonic disc.\\nSpaces appear on the blood islands that develop into vessel lumens. The endothelial lining of the vessels arise from\\nthe angioblasts within these islands. Surrounding mesenchymal cells give rise to the smooth muscle and connective\\ntissue layers of the vessels. While the vessels are developing, the pluripotent stem cells begin to form the blood.\\nVascular tubes also develop on the blood islands, and they eventually connect to one another as well as to the\\ndeveloping, tubular heart. Thus, the developmental pattern, rather than beginning from the formation of one central\\nvessel and spreading outward, occurs in many regions simultaneously with vessels later joining together. This\\nangiogenesis—the creation of new blood vessels from existing ones—continues as needed throughout life as we\\ngrow and develop.\\nBlood vessel development often follows the same pattern as nerve development and travels to the same target\\ntissues and organs. This occurs because the many factors directing growth of nerves also stimulate blood vessels to\\nfollow a similar pattern. Whether a given vessel develops into an artery or a vein is dependent upon local\\nconcentrations of signaling proteins.\\nAs the embryo grows within the mother’s uterus, its requirements for nutrients and gas exchange also grow. The\\nplacenta—a circulatory organ unique to pregnancy—develops jointly from the embryo and uterine wall structures to\\nfill this need. Emerging from the placenta is the umbilical vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the pregnant\\nperson to the fetal inferior vena cava via the ductus venosus to the heart that pumps it into fetal circulation. Two\\numbilical arteries carry oxygen-depleted fetal blood, including wastes and carbon dioxide, to the placenta.\\nRemnants of the umbilical arteries remain in the adult. (Seek additional content for more information on the role of\\nthe placenta in fetal circulation.)\\nThere are three major shunts—alternate paths for blood flow—found in the circulatory system of the fetus. Two of\\nthese shunts divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, whereas the third connects the umbilical vein\\nto the inferior vena cava. The first two shunts are critical during fetal life, when the lungs are compressed, filled with\\namniotic fluid, and nonfunctional, and gas exchange is provided by the placenta. These shunts close shortly after\\nbirth, however, when the newborn begins to breathe. The third shunt persists a bit longer but becomes\\nnonfunctional once the umbilical cord is severed. The three shunts are as follows (Figure 20.44):\\n• The foramen ovale is an opening in the interatrial septum that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the\\nleft atrium. A valve associated with this opening prevents backflow of blood during the fetal period. As the\\nnewborn begins to breathe and blood pressure in the atria increases, this shunt closes. The fossa ovalis remains\\nin the interatrial septum after birth, marking the location of the former foramen ovale.\\n• The ductus arteriosus is a short, muscular vessel that connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. Most of the\\nblood pumped from the right ventricle into the pulmonary trunk is thereby diverted into the aorta. Only enough\\nblood reaches the fetal lungs to maintain the developing lung tissue. When the newborn takes the first breath,\\npressure within the lungs drops dramatically, and both the lungs and the pulmonary vessels expand. As the\\namount of oxygen increases, the smooth muscles in the wall of the ductus arteriosus constrict, sealing off the\\npassage. Eventually, the muscular and endothelial components of the ductus arteriosus degenerate, leaving\\nonly the connective tissue component of the ligamentum arteriosum.\\n• The ductus venosus is a temporary blood vessel that branches from the umbilical vein, allowing much of the\\nfreshly oxygenated blood from the placenta—the organ of gas exchange between the pregnant person and\\nfetus—to bypass the fetal liver and go directly to the fetal heart. The ductus venosus closes slowly during the\\nfirst weeks of infancy and degenerates to become the ligamentum venosum.\\n20.6 • Development of Blood Vessels and Fetal Circulation 879'),\n",

The tunica externa is primarily a layer of\\nconnective tissue, although in veins, it also contains\\nsome smooth muscle. Blood flow through vessels can\\nbe dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and\\nvasodilation in their walls.\\n20.2 Blood Flow, Blood Pressure, and\\nResistance\\nBlood flow is the movement of blood through a vessel,\\ntissue, or organ. The slowing or blocking of blood flow\\nis called resistance. Blood pressure is the force that\\nblood exerts upon the walls of the blood vessels or\\nchambers of the heart. The components of blood\\npressure include systolic pressure, which results from\\nventricular contraction, and diastolic pressure, which\\nresults from ventricular relaxation. Pulse pressure is\\nthe difference between systolic and diastolic\\nmeasures, and mean arterial pressure is the “average”\\npressure of blood in the arterial system, driving blood\\ninto the tissues. Pulse, the expansion and recoiling of\\nan artery, reflects the heartbeat. The variables\\naffecting blood flow and blood pressure in the systemic\\ncirculation are cardiac output, compliance, blood\\nvolume, blood viscosity, and the length and diameter of\\nthe blood vessels. In the arterial system, vasodilation\\nand vasoconstriction of the arterioles is a significant\\nfactor in systemic blood pressure: Slight vasodilation\\ngreatly decreases resistance and increases flow,\\nwhereas slight vasoconstriction greatly increases\\nresistance and decreases flow. In the arterial system,\\nas resistance increases, blood pressure increases and\\nflow decreases. In the venous system, constriction\\nincreases blood pressure as it does in arteries; the\\nincreasing pressure helps to return blood to the heart.\\nIn addition, constriction causes the vessel lumen to\\nbecome more rounded, decreasing resistance and\\nincreasing blood flow. Venoconstriction, while less\\nimportant than arterial vasoconstriction, works with\\nthe skeletal muscle pump, the respiratory pump, and\\ntheir valves to promote venous return to the heart.\\n20.3 Capillary Exchange\\nSmall molecules can cross into and out of capillaries\\nvia simple or facilitated diffusion. Some large\\nmolecules can cross in vesicles or through clefts,\\nfenestrations, or gaps between cells in capillary walls.\\nHowever, the bulk flow of capillary and tissue fluid\\noccurs via filtration and reabsorption. Filtration, the\\nmovement of fluid out of the capillaries, is driven by the\\nCHP. Reabsorption, the influx of tissue fluid into the\\ncapillaries, is driven by the BCOP. Filtration\\npredominates in the arterial end of the capillary; in the\\nmiddle section, the opposing pressures are virtually\\nidentical so there is no net exchange, whereas\\nreabsorption predominates at the venule end of the\\ncapillary. The hydrostatic and colloid osmotic\\npressures in the interstitial fluid are negligible in\\nhealthy circumstances.\\n20.4 Homeostatic Regulation of the\\nVascular System\\nNeural, endocrine, and autoregulatory mechanisms\\naffect blood flow, blood pressure, and eventually\\nperfusion of blood to body tissues. Neural mechanisms\\ninclude the cardiovascular centers in the medulla\\noblongata, baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid\\narteries and right atrium, and associated\\nchemoreceptors that monitor blood levels of oxygen,\\ncarbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions. Endocrine controls\\ninclude epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as\\nADH, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism,\\nANH, and EPO. Autoregulation is the local control of\\nvasodilation and constriction by chemical signals and\\nthe myogenic response. Exercise greatly improves\\ncardiovascular function and reduces the risk of\\ncardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, a\\nleading cause of heart attacks and strokes. Significant\\nhemorrhage can lead to a form of circulatory shock\\nknown as hypovolemic shock. Sepsis, obstruction, and\\nwidespread inflammation can also cause circulatory\\nshock.\\n20.5 Circulatory Pathways\\nThe right ventricle pumps oxygen-depleted blood into\\nthe pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary\\narteries, which carry it to the right and left lungs for gas\\nexchange. Oxygen-rich blood is transported by\\npulmonary veins to the left atrium. The left ventricle\\npumps this blood into the aorta. The main regions of\\nthe aorta are the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and\\ndescending aorta, which is further divided into the\\nthoracic and abdominal aorta. The coronary arteries\\nbranch from the ascending aorta. After oxygenating\\ntissues in the capillaries, systemic blood is returned to\\nthe right atrium from the venous system via the\\nsuperior vena cava, which drains most of the veins\\nsuperior to the diaphragm, the inferior vena cava,\\nwhich drains most of the veins inferior to the\\ndiaphragm, and the coronary veins via the coronary\\nsinus.

All five were diagnosed with a rare\\npneumonia caused by a fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii).\\nWhy was this unusual? Although commonly found in the lungs of healthy individuals, this fungus is an opportunistic\\npathogen that causes disease in individuals with suppressed or underdeveloped immune systems. The very young,\\nwhose immune systems have yet to mature, and the elderly, whose immune systems have declined with age, are\\nparticularly susceptible. The five patients from LA, though, were between 29 and 36 years of age and should have\\nbeen in the prime of their lives, immunologically speaking. What could be going on?\\nA few days later, a cluster of eight cases was reported in New York City, also involving young patients, this time\\nexhibiting a rare form of skin cancer known as Kaposi’s sarcoma. This cancer of the cells that line the blood and\\nlymphatic vessels was previously observed as a relatively innocuous disease of the elderly. The disease that doctors\\nsaw in 1981 was frighteningly more severe, with multiple, fast-growing lesions that spread to all parts of the body,\\nincluding the trunk and face. Could the immune systems of these young patients have been compromised in some\\nway? Indeed, when they were tested, they exhibited extremely low numbers of a specific type of white blood cell in\\ntheir bloodstreams, indicating that they had somehow lost a major part of the immune system.\\nAcquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, turned out to be a new disease caused by the previously unknown\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although nearly 100 percent fatal in those with active HIV infections in the\\nearly years, the development of anti-HIV drugs has transformed HIV infection into a chronic, manageable disease\\nand not the certain death sentence it once was. One positive outcome resulting from the emergence of HIV disease\\nwas that the public’s attention became focused as never before on the importance of having a functional and\\nhealthy immune system.\\nFigure 21.1 The Worldwide AIDS Epidemic (a) As of 2008, more than 15 percent of adults were infected with HIV in certain African\\ncountries.

The lymphatic system, for most people, is associated with the immune system to\\nsuch a degree that the two systems are virtually indistinguishable. The lymphatic system is the system of vessels,\\ncells, and organs that carries excess fluids to the bloodstream and filters pathogens from the blood. The swelling of\\nlymph nodes during an infection and the transport of lymphocytes via the lymphatic vessels are but two examples of\\nthe many connections between these critical organ systems.\\nFunctions of the Lymphatic System\\nA major function of the lymphatic system is to drain body fluids and return them to the bloodstream. Blood pressure\\ncauses leakage of fluid from the capillaries, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space—that is,\\nspaces between individual cells in the tissues. In humans, 20 liters of plasma is released into the interstitial space\\nof the tissues each day due to capillary filtration. Once this filtrate is out of the bloodstream and in the tissue\\nspaces, it is referred to as interstitial fluid. Of this, 17 liters is reabsorbed directly by the blood vessels. But what\\nhappens to the remaining three liters? This is where the lymphatic system comes into play. It drains the excess fluid\\nand empties it back into the bloodstream via a series of vessels, trunks, and ducts. Lymph is the term used to\\ndescribe interstitial fluid once it has entered the lymphatic system. When the lymphatic system is damaged in some\\nway, such as by being blocked by cancer cells or destroyed by injury, protein-rich interstitial fluid accumulates\\n(sometimes “backs up” from the lymph vessels) in the tissue spaces. This inappropriate accumulation of fluid\\nreferred to as lymphedema may lead to serious medical consequences.\\nAs the vertebrate immune system evolved, the network of lymphatic vessels became convenient avenues for\\ntransporting the cells of the immune system. Additionally, the transport of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins\\nabsorbed in the gut uses this system.\\nCells of the immune system not only use lymphatic vessels to make their way from interstitial spaces back into the\\ncirculation, but they also use lymph nodes as major staging areas for the development of critical immune responses.\\nA lymph node is one of the small, bean-shaped organs located throughout the lymphatic system.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/lymphsystem) for an overview of the lymphatic system. What are the three\\nmain components of the lymphatic system?\\nStructure of the Lymphatic System\\nThe lymphatic vessels begin as a blind ending, or closed at one end, capillaries, which feed into larger and larger\\nlymphatic vessels, and eventually empty into the bloodstream by a series of ducts. Along the way, the lymph travels\\nthrough the lymph nodes, which are commonly found near the groin, armpits, neck, chest, and abdomen. Humans\\nhave about 500–600 lymph nodes throughout the body (Figure 21.2).\\n894 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

One-way valves (semi-lunar valves) in lymphatic vessels keep the\\nlymph moving toward the heart. Lymph flows from the lymphatic capillaries, through lymphatic vessels, and then is\\ndumped into the circulatory system via the lymphatic ducts located at the junction of the jugular and subclavian\\nveins in the neck.\\nLymphatic Capillaries\\nLymphatic capillaries, also called the terminal lymphatics, are vessels where interstitial fluid enters the lymphatic\\nsystem to become lymph fluid. Located in almost every tissue in the body, these vessels are interlaced among the\\narterioles and venules of the circulatory system in the soft connective tissues of the body (Figure 21.3). Exceptions\\nare the central nervous system, bone marrow, bones, teeth, and the cornea of the eye, which do not contain lymph\\nvessels.\\nFIGURE 21.3 Lymphatic Capillaries Lymphatic capillaries are interlaced with the arterioles and venules of the cardiovascular system.\\nCollagen fibers anchor a lymphatic capillary in the tissue (inset). Interstitial fluid slips through spaces between the overlapping endothelial\\ncells that compose the lymphatic capillary.\\nLymphatic capillaries are formed by a one cell-thick layer of endothelial cells and represent the open end of the\\nsystem, allowing interstitial fluid to flow into them via overlapping cells (see Figure 21.3). When interstitial pressure\\nis low, the endothelial flaps close to prevent “backflow.” As interstitial pressure increases, the spaces between the\\ncells open up, allowing the fluid to enter. Entry of fluid into lymphatic capillaries is also enabled by the collagen\\nfilaments that anchor the capillaries to surrounding structures. As interstitial pressure increases, the filaments pull\\non the endothelial cell flaps, opening up them even further to allow easy entry of fluid.\\nIn the small intestine, lymphatic capillaries called lacteals are critical for the transport of dietary lipids and lipid-\\nsoluble vitamins to the bloodstream. In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides combine with other lipids and\\nproteins, and enter the lacteals to form a milky fluid called chyle. The chyle then travels through the lymphatic\\nsystem, eventually entering the bloodstream.\\nLarger Lymphatic Vessels, Trunks, and Ducts\\nThe lymphatic capillaries empty into larger lymphatic vessels, which are similar to veins in terms of their three-tunic\\nstructure and the presence of valves. These one-way valves are located fairly close to one another, and each one\\ncauses a bulge in the lymphatic vessel, giving the vessels a beaded appearance (see Figure 21.3).\\nThe superficial and deep lymphatics eventually merge to form larger lymphatic vessels known as lymphatic trunks.\\nOn the right side of the body, the right sides of the head, thorax, and right upper limb drain lymph fluid into the right\\nsubclavian vein via the right lymphatic duct (Figure 21.4).

The right lymphatic duct receives lymph\\nfrom only the upper right side of the body. The lymph from the rest of the body enters the bloodstream through the\\nthoracic duct via all the remaining lymphatic trunks. In general, lymphatic vessels of the subcutaneous tissues of\\nthe skin, that is, the superficial lymphatics, follow the same routes as veins, whereas the deep lymphatic vessels of\\nthe viscera generally follow the paths of arteries.\\nThe Organization of Immune Function\\nThe immune system is a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble proteins that interact and communicate with each\\nother in extraordinarily complex ways. The modern model of immune function is organized into three phases based\\non the timing of their effects. The three temporal phases consist of the following:\\n• Barrier defenses such as the skin and mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic\\ninvasion into the body tissues\\n• The rapid but nonspecific innate immune response, which consists of a variety of specialized cells and soluble\\nfactors\\n• The slower but more specific and effective adaptive immune response, which involves many cell types and\\nsoluble factors, but is primarily controlled by white blood cells (leukocytes) known as lymphocytes, which help\\ncontrol immune responses\\nThe cells of the blood, including all those involved in the immune response, arise in the bone marrow via various\\ndifferentiation pathways from hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 21.5).

Platelets are cell fragments involved in the clotting of blood.\\nLymphocytes: B Cells, T Cells, Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells\\nAs stated above, lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses (Table 21.1). The two basic types\\nof lymphocytes, B cells and T cells, are identical morphologically with a large central nucleus surrounded by a thin\\nlayer of cytoplasm. They are distinguished from each other by their surface protein markers as well as by the\\nmolecules they secrete. While B cells mature in red bone marrow and T cells mature in the thymus, they both\\ninitially develop from bone marrow. T cells migrate from bone marrow to the thymus gland where they further\\nmature. B cells and T cells are found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and\\nresiding in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes, which will be described later in this\\nsection. The human body contains approximately 1012 lymphocytes.\\nB Cells\\nB cells are immune cells that function primarily by producing antibodies. An antibody is any of the group of proteins\\nthat binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens. An antigen is a chemical structure on\\nthe surface of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors. Once activated by binding to antigen, B\\ncells differentiate into cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. These activated B cells are\\nknown as plasma cells.\\nT Cells\\nThe T cell, on the other hand, does not secrete antibody but performs a variety of functions in the adaptive immune\\nresponse. Different T cell types have the ability to either secrete soluble factors that communicate with other cells\\nof the adaptive immune response or destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens.

A plasma cell is a B cell that has differentiated in\\nresponse to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies. These cells differ in\\nmorphology from standard B and T cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm packed with the protein-\\nsynthesizing machinery known as rough endoplasmic reticulum.\\nNatural Killer Cells\\nA fourth important lymphocyte is the natural killer cell, a participant in the innate immune response. A natural killer\\ncell (NK) is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm.

It is through this process that the body (ideally) learns to destroy only pathogens and leaves the\\nbody’s own cells relatively intact. The primary lymphoid organs are the bone marrow and thymus gland. The\\nlymphoid organs are where lymphocytes mature, proliferate, and are selected, which enables them to attack\\npathogens without harming the cells of the body.\\nBone Marrow\\nIn the embryo, blood cells are made in the yolk sac. As development proceeds, this function is taken over by the\\nspleen, lymph nodes, and liver. Later, the bone marrow takes over most hematopoietic functions, although the final\\nstages of the differentiation of some cells may take place in other organs. The red bone marrow is a loose collection\\nof cells where hematopoiesis occurs, and the yellow bone marrow is a site of energy storage, which consists largely\\nof fat cells (Figure 21.6). The B cell undergoes nearly all of its development in the red bone marrow, whereas the\\nimmature T cell, called a thymocyte, leaves the bone marrow and matures largely in the thymus gland.\\n21.1 • Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems 899'),\n",

A naïve lymphocyte is one that has left the primary organ and entered a secondary\\nlymphoid organ. Naïve lymphocytes are fully functional immunologically, but have yet to encounter an antigen to\\nrespond to. In addition to circulating in the blood and lymph, lymphocytes concentrate in secondary lymphoid\\norgans, which include the lymph nodes, spleen, and lymphoid nodules. All of these tissues have many features in\\ncommon, including the following:\\n• The presence of lymphoid follicles, the sites of the formation of lymphocytes, with specific B cell-rich and T cell-\\nrich areas\\n• An internal structure of reticular fibers with associated fixed macrophages\\n• Germinal centers, which are the sites of rapidly dividing and differentiating B lymphocytes\\n• Specialized post-capillary vessels known as high endothelial venules; the cells lining these venules are thicker\\nand more columnar than normal endothelial cells, which allow cells from the blood to directly enter these\\ntissues\\nLymph Nodes\\nLymph nodes function to remove debris and pathogens from the lymph, and are thus sometimes referred to as the\\n“filters of the lymph” (Figure 21.8). Any bacteria that infect the interstitial fluid are taken up by the lymphatic\\ncapillaries and transported to a regional lymph node. Dendritic cells and macrophages within this organ internalize\\nand kill many of the pathogens that pass through, thereby removing them from the body. The lymph node is also the\\nAging and the...\\nImmune System\\nBy the year 2050, 25 percent of the population of the United States will be 60 years of age or older. The CDC\\nestimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with\\ndeficiencies of the immune systems. This loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. To\\ntreat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause\\nof age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at\\na rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines\\nto about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue\\nand thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human\\nlifespan.\\nThymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have\\nshown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the\\ndonor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the\\nthymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to\\nthe decreasing expression of the FOXN1 gene with age.\\nIt is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and\\ntestosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant people cause a temporary thymic\\ninvolution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after\\nlactation ceases. What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The\\npotential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve T cells high.\\nGene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities. The more we learn through\\nimmunosenescence research, the more opportunities there will be to develop therapies, even though these\\ntherapies will likely take decades to develop. The ultimate goal is for everyone to live and be healthy longer, but\\nthere may be limits to immortality imposed by our genes and hormones.\\n21.1 • Anatomy of the Lymphatic and Immune Systems 901'),\n",

Barrier defenses are part of the body’s most basic defense\\nmechanisms. The barrier defenses are not a response to infections, but they are continuously working to protect\\nagainst a broad range of pathogens.\\nThe different modes of barrier defenses are associated with the external surfaces of the body, where pathogens may\\ntry to enter (Table 21.2). The primary barrier to the entrance of microorganisms into the body is the skin. Not only is\\nthe skin covered with a layer of dead, keratinized epithelium that is too dry for bacteria in which to grow, but as\\nthese cells are continuously sloughed off from the skin, they carry bacteria and other pathogens with them.\\nAdditionally, sweat and other skin secretions may lower pH, contain toxic lipids, and physically wash microbes away.\\nBarrier Defenses\\nSite Specific defense Protective aspect\\nSkin Epidermal surface Keratinized cells of surface, Langerhans cells\\nSkin (sweat/secretions) Sweat glands, sebaceous\\nglands Low pH, washing action\\nTABLE 21.2\\n906 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The acidic environment of the stomach, which is fatal to many pathogens, is also a barrier.\\nAdditionally, the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, eyes, ears, and nose\\ntraps both microbes and debris, and facilitates their removal. In the case of the upper respiratory tract, ciliated\\nepithelial cells move potentially contaminated mucus upwards to the mouth, where it is then swallowed into the\\ndigestive tract, ending up in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. Considering how often you breathe\\ncompared to how often you eat or perform other activities that expose you to pathogens, it is not surprising that\\nmultiple barrier mechanisms have evolved to work in concert to protect this vital area.\\nCells of the Innate Immune Response\\nA phagocyte is a cell that is able to surround and engulf a particle or cell, a process called phagocytosis. The\\nphagocytes of the immune system engulf other particles or cells, either to clean an area of debris, old cells, or to kill\\npathogenic organisms such as bacteria. The phagocytes are the body’s fast acting, first line of immunological\\ndefense against organisms that have breached barrier defenses and have entered the vulnerable tissues of the body.\\nPhagocytes: Macrophages and Neutrophils\\nMany of the cells of the immune system have a phagocytic ability, at least at some point during their life cycles.\\nPhagocytosis is an important and effective mechanism of destroying pathogens during innate immune responses.\\nThe phagocyte takes the organism inside itself as a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with a lysosome and its\\ndigestive enzymes, effectively killing many pathogens. On the other hand, some bacteria including Mycobacteria\\ntuberculosis, the cause of tuberculosis, may be resistant to these enzymes and are therefore much more difficult to\\nclear from the body. Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are the major phagocytes of the immune system.\\nA macrophage is an irregularly shaped phagocyte that is amoeboid in nature and is the most versatile of the\\nphagocytes in the body. Macrophages move through tissues and squeeze through capillary walls using pseudopodia.\\nThey not only participate in innate immune responses but have also evolved to cooperate with lymphocytes as part\\nof the adaptive immune response. Macrophages exist in many tissues of the body, either freely roaming through\\nconnective tissues or fixed to reticular fibers within specific tissues such as lymph nodes. When pathogens breach\\nthe body’s barrier defenses, macrophages are the first line of defense (Table 21.3). They are called different names,\\ndepending on the tissue: Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes in connective tissue, and alveolar macrophages in the\\nlungs.\\nA neutrophil is a phagocytic cell that is attracted via chemotaxis from the bloodstream to infected tissues. These\\nspherical cells are granulocytes. A granulocyte contains cytoplasmic granules, which in turn contain a variety of\\nvasoactive mediators such as histamine. In contrast, macrophages are agranulocytes. An agranulocyte has few or no\\ncytoplasmic granules.

NK cells recognize these\\ncells by mechanisms that are still not well understood, but that presumably involve their surface receptors. NK cells\\ncan induce apoptosis, in which a cascade of events inside the cell causes its own death by either of two\\nmechanisms:\\n1) NK cells are able to respond to chemical signals and express the fas ligand. The fas ligand is a surface molecule\\nthat binds to the fas molecule on the surface of the infected cell, sending it apoptotic signals, thus killing the cell\\nand the pathogen within it; or\\n2) The granules of the NK cells release perforins and granzymes. A perforin is a protein that forms pores in the\\nmembranes of infected cells. A granzyme is a protein-digesting enzyme that enters the cell via the perforin pores\\nand triggers apoptosis intracellularly.\\nBoth mechanisms are especially effective against virally infected cells. If apoptosis is induced before the virus has\\nthe ability to synthesize and assemble all its components, no infectious virus will be released from the cell, thus\\npreventing further infection.\\nRecognition of Pathogens\\nCells of the innate immune response, the phagocytic cells, and the cytotoxic NK cells recognize patterns of\\npathogen-specific molecules, such as bacterial cell wall components or bacterial flagellar proteins, using pattern\\nrecognition receptors. A pattern recognition receptor (PRR) is a membrane-bound receptor that recognizes\\ncharacteristic features of a pathogen and molecules released by stressed or damaged cells.\\nThese receptors, which are thought to have evolved prior to the adaptive immune response, are present on the cell\\nsurface whether they are needed or not. Their variety, however, is limited by two factors. First, the fact that each\\nreceptor type must be encoded by a specific gene requires the cell to allocate most or all of its DNA to make\\nreceptors able to recognize all pathogens. Secondly, the variety of receptors is limited by the finite surface area of\\nthe cell membrane. Thus, the innate immune system must “get by” using only a limited number of receptors that are\\nactive against as wide a variety of pathogens as possible. This strategy is in stark contrast to the approach used by\\nthe adaptive immune system, which uses large numbers of different receptors, each highly specific to a particular\\npathogen.\\nShould the cells of the innate immune system come into contact with a species of pathogen they recognize, the cell\\nwill bind to the pathogen and initiate phagocytosis (or cellular apoptosis in the case of an intracellular pathogen) in\\nan effort to destroy the offending microbe. Receptors vary somewhat according to cell type, but they usually include\\nreceptors for bacterial components and for complement, discussed below.\\nSoluble Mediators of the Innate Immune Response\\nThe previous discussions have alluded to chemical signals that can induce cells to change various physiological\\ncharacteristics, such as the expression of a particular receptor.

A chemokine is a soluble chemical mediator similar to cytokines except that its function is to attract\\ncells (chemotaxis) from longer distances.\\nINTER ACTIVE LINK\\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/chemotaxis) to learn about phagocyte chemotaxis. Phagocyte chemotaxis is\\nthe movement of phagocytes according to the secretion of chemical messengers in the form of interleukins and\\nother chemokines. By what means does a phagocyte destroy a bacterium that it has ingested?\\nEarly induced Proteins\\nEarly induced proteins are those that are not constitutively present in the body, but are made as they are needed\\nearly during the innate immune response. Interferons are an example of early induced proteins. Cells infected with\\nviruses secrete interferons that travel to adjacent cells and induce them to make antiviral proteins. Thus, even\\nthough the initial cell is sacrificed, the surrounding cells are protected. Other early induced proteins specific for\\nbacterial cell wall components are mannose-binding protein and C-reactive protein, made in the liver, which bind\\nspecifically to polysaccharide components of the bacterial cell wall. Phagocytes such as macrophages have\\nreceptors for these proteins, and they are thus able to recognize them as they are bound to the bacteria. This brings\\nthe phagocyte and bacterium into close proximity and enhances the phagocytosis of the bacterium by the process\\nknown as opsonization. Opsonization is the tagging of a pathogen for phagocytosis by the binding of an antibody or\\nan antimicrobial protein.\\nComplement System\\nThe complement system is a series of proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma. As such, these proteins are\\nnot considered part of the early induced immune response, even though they share features with some of the\\nantibacterial proteins of this class. Made in the liver, they have a variety of functions in the innate immune response,\\nusing what is known as the “alternate pathway” of complement activation. Additionally, complement functions in\\nthe adaptive immune response as well, in what is called the classical pathway. The complement system consists of\\nseveral proteins that enzymatically alter and fragment later proteins in a series, which is why it is termed cascade.\\nOnce activated, the series of reactions is irreversible, and releases fragments that have the following actions:\\n• Bind to the cell membrane of the pathogen that activates it, labeling it for phagocytosis (opsonization)\\n• Diffuse away from the pathogen and act as chemotactic agents to attract phagocytic cells to the site of\\ninflammation\\n• Form damaging pores in the plasma membrane of the pathogen\\nFigure 21.13 shows the classical pathway, which requires antibodies of the adaptive immune response.

Surface-bound C3b then activates the rest of the cascade,\\nwith the last five proteins, C5–C9, forming the membrane-attack complex (MAC). The MAC can kill certain\\npathogens by disrupting their osmotic balance. The MAC is especially effective against a broad range of bacteria.\\nThe classical pathway is similar, except the early stages of activation require the presence of antibody bound to\\nantigen, and thus is dependent on the adaptive immune response. The earlier fragments of the cascade also have\\nimportant functions. Phagocytic cells such as macrophages and neutrophils are attracted to an infection site by\\nchemotactic attraction to smaller complement fragments. Additionally, once they arrive, their receptors for surface-\\nbound C3b opsonize the pathogen for phagocytosis and destruction.\\nInflammatory Response\\nThe hallmark of the innate immune response is inflammation. Inflammation is something everyone has\\nexperienced. Stub a toe, cut a finger, or do any activity that causes tissue damage and inflammation will result, with\\nits four characteristics: heat, redness, pain, and swelling (“loss of function” is sometimes mentioned as a fifth\\ncharacteristic). It is important to note that inflammation does not have to be initiated by an infection, but can also be\\ncaused by tissue injuries. The release of damaged cellular contents into the site of injury is enough to stimulate the\\nresponse, even in the absence of breaks in physical barriers that would allow pathogens to enter (by hitting your\\nthumb with a hammer, for example). The inflammatory reaction brings in phagocytic cells to the damaged area to\\n910 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Inflammation is part of a very basic form of immune response. The process not only brings fluid\\nand cells into the site to destroy the pathogen and remove it and debris from the site, but also helps to isolate the\\nsite, limiting the spread of the pathogen. Acute inflammation is a short-term inflammatory response to an insult to\\nthe body. If the cause of the inflammation is not resolved, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation, which is\\nassociated with major tissue destruction and fibrosis. Chronic inflammation is ongoing inflammation. It can be\\ncaused by foreign bodies, persistent pathogens, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.\\nThere are four important parts to the inflammatory response:\\n• Tissue Injury. The released contents of injured cells stimulate the release of mast cell granules and their potent\\ninflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. Histamine increases the\\ndiameter of local blood vessels (vasodilation), causing an increase in blood flow. Histamine also increases the\\npermeability of local capillaries, causing plasma to leak out and form interstitial fluid. This causes the swelling\\nassociated with inflammation.\\nAdditionally, injured cells, phagocytes, and basophils are sources of inflammatory mediators, including\\nprostaglandins and leukotrienes. Leukotrienes attract neutrophils from the blood by chemotaxis and increase\\nvascular permeability. Prostaglandins cause vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle and are a major\\ncause of the pain associated with inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and\\nibuprofen relieve pain by inhibiting prostaglandin production.\\n• Vasodilation. Many inflammatory mediators such as histamine are vasodilators that increase the diameters of\\nlocal capillaries. This causes increased blood flow and is responsible for the heat and redness of inflamed\\ntissue. It allows greater access of the blood to the site of inflammation.\\n• Increased Vascular Permeability. At the same time, inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the\\nlocal vasculature, causing leakage of fluid into the interstitial space, resulting in the swelling, or edema,\\nassociated with inflammation.\\n• Recruitment of Phagocytes. Leukotrienes are particularly good at attracting neutrophils from the blood to the\\nsite of infection by chemotaxis.

Not only are the pathogens killed and debris removed, but the\\nincrease in vascular permeability encourages the entry of clotting factors, the first step towards wound repair.\\nInflammation also facilitates the transport of antigen to lymph nodes by dendritic cells for the development of the\\nadaptive immune response.\\n21.3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional\\nTypes\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the advantages of the adaptive immune response over the innate immune response\\n• List the various characteristics of an antigen\\n• Describe the types of T cell antigen receptors\\n• Outline the steps of T cell development\\n• Describe the major T cell types and their functions\\nInnate immune responses (and early induced responses) are in many cases ineffective at completely controlling\\npathogen growth. However, they slow pathogen growth and allow time for the adaptive immune response to\\nstrengthen and either control or eliminate the pathogen. The innate immune system also sends signals to the cells\\nof the adaptive immune system, guiding them in how to attack the pathogen. Thus, these are the two important\\narms of the immune response.\\nThe Benefits of the Adaptive Immune Response\\nThe specificity of the adaptive immune response—its ability to specifically recognize and make a response against a\\nwide variety of pathogens—is its great strength. Antigens, the small chemical groups often associated with\\npathogens, are recognized by receptors on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. The adaptive immune response to\\nthese antigens is so versatile that it can respond to nearly any pathogen. This increase in specificity comes because\\nthe adaptive immune response has a unique way to develop as many as 1011, or 100 trillion, different receptors to\\nrecognize nearly every conceivable pathogen. How could so many different types of antibodies be encoded? And\\nwhat about the many specificities of T cells? There is not nearly enough DNA in a cell to have a separate gene for\\neach specificity. The mechanism was finally worked out in the 1970s and 1980s using the new tools of molecular\\ngenetics.\\nPrimary Disease and Immunological Memory\\nThe immune system’s first exposure to a pathogen is called a primary adaptive response. Symptoms of a first\\ninfection, called primary disease, are always relatively severe because it takes time for an initial adaptive immune\\nresponse to a pathogen to become effective.\\nUpon re-exposure to the same pathogen, a secondary adaptive immune response is generated, which is stronger\\nand faster than the primary response. The secondary adaptive response often eliminates a pathogen before it can\\ncause significant tissue damage or any symptoms. Without symptoms, there is no disease, and the individual is not\\neven aware of the infection. This secondary response is the basis of immunological memory, which protects us\\nfrom getting diseases repeatedly from the same pathogen. By this mechanism, an individual’s exposure to\\npathogens early in life spares the person from these diseases later in life.\\nSelf Recognition\\nA third important feature of the adaptive immune response is its ability to distinguish between self-antigens, those\\nthat are normally present in the body, and foreign antigens, those that might be on a potential pathogen. As T and B\\ncells mature, there are mechanisms in place that prevent them from recognizing self-antigen, preventing a\\ndamaging immune response against the body. These mechanisms are not 100 percent effective, however, and their\\nbreakdown leads to autoimmune diseases, which will be discussed later in this chapter.\\n912 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

T cells are\\nparticularly important, as they not only control a multitude of immune responses directly, but also control B cell\\nimmune responses in many cases as well. Thus, many of the decisions about how to attack a pathogen are made at\\nthe T cell level, and knowledge of their functional types is crucial to understanding the functioning and regulation of\\nadaptive immune responses as a whole.\\nT lymphocytes recognize antigens based on a two-chain protein receptor. The most common and important of these\\nare the alpha-beta T cell receptors (Figure 21.15).\\nFIGURE 21.15 Alpha-beta T Cell Receptor Notice the constant and variable regions of each chain, anchored by the transmembrane\\nregion.\\nThere are two chains in the T cell receptor, and each chain consists of two domains. The variable region domain is\\nfurthest away from the T cell membrane and is so named because its amino acid sequence varies between\\nreceptors. In contrast, the constant region domain has less variation. The differences in the amino acid sequences\\nof the variable domains are the molecular basis of the diversity of antigens the receptor can recognize. Thus, the\\nantigen-binding site of the receptor consists of the terminal ends of both receptor chains, and the amino acid\\nsequences of those two areas combine to determine its antigenic specificity. Each T cell produces only one type of\\nreceptor and thus is specific for a single particular antigen.\\nAntigens\\nAntigens on pathogens are usually large and complex, and consist of many antigenic determinants. An antigenic\\ndeterminant (epitope) is one of the small regions within an antigen to which a receptor can bind, and antigenic\\ndeterminants are limited by the size of the receptor itself. They usually consist of six or fewer amino acid residues in\\na protein, or one or two sugar moieties in a carbohydrate antigen. Antigenic determinants on a carbohydrate antigen\\nare usually less diverse than on a protein antigen. Carbohydrate antigens are found on bacterial cell walls and on red\\nblood cells (the ABO blood group antigens). Protein antigens are complex because of the variety of three-\\ndimensional shapes that proteins can assume, and are especially important for the immune responses to viruses\\nand worm parasites. It is the interaction of the shape of the antigen and the complementary shape of the amino\\nacids of the antigen-binding site that accounts for the chemical basis of specificity (Figure 21.16).\\n21.3 • The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types 913'),\n",

T cells do not recognize free-floating or cell-bound\\nantigens as they appear on the surface of the pathogen. They only recognize antigen on the surface of specialized\\ncells called antigen-presenting cells. Antigens are internalized by these cells. Antigen processing is a mechanism\\nthat enzymatically cleaves the antigen into smaller pieces. The antigen fragments are then brought to the cell’s\\nsurface and associated with a specialized type of antigen-presenting protein known as a major histocompatibility\\ncomplex (MHC) molecule. The MHC is the cluster of genes that encode these antigen-presenting molecules. The\\nassociation of the antigen fragments with an MHC molecule on the surface of a cell is known as antigen\\npresentation and results in the recognition of antigen by a T cell. This association of antigen and MHC occurs inside\\nthe cell, and it is the complex of the two that is brought to the surface. The peptide-binding cleft is a small\\nindentation at the end of the MHC molecule that is furthest away from the cell membrane; it is here that the\\nprocessed fragment of antigen sits. MHC molecules are capable of presenting a variety of antigens, depending on\\nthe amino acid sequence, in their peptide-binding clefts. It is the combination of the MHC molecule and the\\nfragment of the original peptide or carbohydrate that is actually physically recognized by the T cell receptor (Figure\\n21.17).\\n914 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Although\\nproduced from different genes, they both have similar functions. They bring processed antigen to the surface of the\\ncell via a transport vesicle and present the antigen to the T cell and its receptor. Antigens from different classes of\\npathogens, however, use different MHC classes and take different routes through the cell to get to the surface for\\npresentation. The basic mechanism, though, is the same. Antigens are processed by digestion, are brought into the\\nendomembrane system of the cell, and then are expressed on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell for antigen\\nrecognition by a T cell. Intracellular antigens are typical of viruses, which replicate inside the cell, and certain other\\nintracellular parasites and bacteria. These antigens are processed in the cytosol by an enzyme complex known as\\nthe proteasome and are then brought into the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen\\nprocessing (TAP) system, where they interact with class I MHC molecules and are eventually transported to the cell\\nsurface by a transport vesicle.\\nExtracellular antigens, characteristic of many bacteria, parasites, and fungi that do not replicate inside the cell’s\\ncytoplasm, are brought into the endomembrane system of the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The resulting\\nvesicle fuses with vesicles from the Golgi complex, which contain pre-formed MHC class II molecules.

This proliferation of T cells is called clonal expansion and is necessary to\\nmake the immune response strong enough to effectively control a pathogen. How does the body select only those T\\ncells that are needed against a specific pathogen? Again, the specificity of a T cell is based on the amino acid\\nsequence and the three-dimensional shape of the antigen-binding site formed by the variable regions of the two\\nchains of the T cell receptor (Figure 21.19). Clonal selection is the process of antigen binding only to those T cells\\nthat have receptors specific to that antigen. Each T cell that is activated has a specific receptor “hard-wired” into its\\nDNA, and all of its progeny will have identical DNA and T cell receptors, forming clones of the original T cell.\\nFIGURE 21.19 Clonal Selection and Expansion of T Lymphocytes Stem cells differentiate into T cells with specific receptors, called\\nclones. The clones with receptors specific for antigens on the pathogen are selected for and expanded.\\nClonal Selection and Expansion\\nThe clonal selection theory was proposed by Frank Burnet in the 1950s. However, the term clonal selection is not a\\ncomplete description of the theory, as clonal expansion goes hand in glove with the selection process. The main\\ntenet of the theory is that a typical individual has a multitude (1011) of different types of T cell clones based on their\\nreceptors. In this use, a clone is a group of lymphocytes that share the same antigen receptor. Each clone is\\nnecessarily present in the body in low numbers. Otherwise, the body would not have room for lymphocytes with so\\nmany specificities.\\nOnly those clones of lymphocytes whose receptors are activated by the antigen are stimulated to proliferate. Keep in\\nmind that most antigens have multiple antigenic determinants, so a T cell response to a typical antigen involves a\\npolyclonal response. A polyclonal response is the stimulation of multiple T cell clones. Once activated, the selected\\nclones increase in number and make many copies of each cell type, each clone with its unique receptor. By the time\\nthis process is complete, the body will have large numbers of specific lymphocytes available to fight the infection\\n(see Figure 21.19).\\n918 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Memory T\\ncells are long-lived and can even persist for a lifetime. Memory cells are primed to act rapidly. Thus, any subsequent\\nexposure to the pathogen will elicit a very rapid T cell response. This rapid, secondary adaptive response generates\\nlarge numbers of effector T cells so fast that the pathogen is often overwhelmed before it can cause any symptoms\\nof disease. This is what is meant by immunity to a disease. The same pattern of primary and secondary immune\\nresponses occurs in B cells and the antibody response, as will be discussed later in the chapter.\\nT Cell Types and their Functions\\nIn the discussion of T cell development, you saw that mature T cells express either the CD4 marker or the CD8\\nmarker, but not both. These markers are cell adhesion molecules that keep the T cell in close contact with the\\nantigen-presenting cell by directly binding to the MHC molecule (to a different part of the molecule than does the\\nantigen). Thus, T cells and antigen-presenting cells are held together in two ways: by CD4 or CD8 attaching to MHC\\nand by the T cell receptor binding to antigen (Figure 21.20).\\nFIGURE 21.20 Pathogen Presentation (a) CD4 is associated with helper and regulatory T cells. An extracellular pathogen is processed\\nand presented in the binding cleft of a class II MHC molecule, and this interaction is strengthened by the CD4 molecule.

An intracellular pathogen is presented by a class I MHC molecule, and CD8 interacts with it.\\nAlthough the correlation is not 100 percent, CD4-bearing T cells are associated with helper functions and\\nCD8-bearing T cells are associated with cytotoxicity. These functional distinctions based on CD4 and CD8 markers\\nare useful in defining the function of each type.\\nHelper T Cells and their Cytokines\\nHelper T cells (Th), bearing the CD4 molecule, function by secreting cytokines that act to enhance other immune\\nresponses. There are two classes of Th cells, and they act on different components of the immune response. These\\ncells are not distinguished by their surface molecules but by the characteristic set of cytokines they secrete (Table\\n21.5).\\n21.3 • The Adaptive Immune Response: T lymphocytes and Their Functional Types 919'),\n",

Early microbiologists took serum from an immune patient and mixed it with a\\nfresh culture of the same type of bacteria, then observed the bacteria under a microscope. The bacteria became\\nclumped in a process called agglutination. When a different bacterial species was used, the agglutination did not\\nhappen. Thus, there was something in the serum of immune individuals that could specifically bind to and\\nagglutinate bacteria.\\nScientists now know the cause of the agglutination is an antibody molecule, also called an immunoglobulin. What is\\nan antibody? An antibody protein is essentially a secreted form of a B cell receptor. (In fact, surface immunoglobulin\\nis another name for the B cell receptor.) Not surprisingly, the same genes encode both the secreted antibodies and\\nthe surface immunoglobulins. One minor difference in the way these proteins are synthesized distinguishes a naïve\\nB cell with antibody on its surface from an antibody-secreting plasma cell with no antibodies on its surface. The\\nantibodies of the plasma cell have the exact same antigen-binding site and specificity as their B cell precursors.\\nThere are five different classes of antibody found in humans: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE. Each of these has specific\\nfunctions in the immune response, so by learning about them, researchers can learn about the great variety of\\nantibody functions critical to many adaptive immune responses.\\nB cells do not recognize antigen in the complex fashion of T cells. B cells can recognize native, unprocessed antigen\\nand do not require the participation of MHC molecules and antigen-presenting cells.\\nB Cell Differentiation and Activation\\nB cells differentiate in the bone marrow. During the process of maturation, up to 100 trillion different clones of B\\ncells are generated, which is similar to the diversity of antigen receptors seen in T cells.\\nB cell differentiation and the development of tolerance are not quite as well understood as it is in T cells. Central\\ntolerance is the destruction or inactivation of B cells that recognize self-antigens in the bone marrow, and its role is\\ncritical and well established. In the process of clonal deletion, immature B cells that bind strongly to self-antigens\\nexpressed on tissues are signaled to induce their own destruction by apoptosis, removing them from the population.\\nIn the process of clonal anergy, however, B cells exposed to soluble antigen in the bone marrow are not physically\\ndeleted, but become unable to function.\\nAnother mechanism called peripheral tolerance is a direct result of T cell tolerance. In peripheral tolerance,\\nfunctional, mature B cells leave the bone marrow but have yet to be exposed to self-antigen. Most protein antigens\\nrequire signals from helper T cells (Th2) to proceed to make antibody. When a B cell binds to a self-antigen but\\nreceives no signals from a nearby Th2 cell to produce antibody, the cell is signaled to undergo apoptosis and is\\ndestroyed. This is yet another example of the control that T cells have over the adaptive immune response.\\nAfter B cells are activated by their binding to antigen, they differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells often leave\\nthe secondary lymphoid organs, where the response is generated, and migrate back to the bone marrow, where the\\nwhole differentiation process started. After secreting antibodies for a specific period, they die, as most of their\\nenergy is devoted to making antibodies and not to maintaining themselves. Thus, plasma cells are said to be\\nterminally differentiated.\\nThe final B cell of interest is the memory B cell, which results from the clonal expansion of an activated B cell.\\nMemory B cells function in a way similar to memory T cells. They lead to a stronger and faster secondary response\\nwhen compared to the primary response, as illustrated below.\\nAntibody Structure\\nAntibodies are glycoproteins consisting of two types of polypeptide chains with attached carbohydrates. The heavy\\nchain and the light chain are the two polypeptides that form the antibody. The main differences between the\\nclasses of antibodies are in the differences between their heavy chains, but as you shall see, the light chains have an\\nimportant role, forming part of the antigen-binding site on the antibody molecules.\\nFour-chain Models of Antibody Structures\\nAll antibody molecules have two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.

Only IgM is secreted, however, and no other nonreceptor function for IgD has been discovered.\\nFIGURE 21.22 Five Classes of Antibodies\\nIgM consists of five four-chain structures (20 total chains with 10 identical antigen-binding sites) and is thus the\\nlargest of the antibody molecules.

It is excellent at binding complement\\nproteins and activating the complement cascade, consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis, opsonization,\\nand cell lysis. Thus, it is a very effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response. As\\nthe primary response proceeds, the antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG, IgA, or IgE by the process\\nknown as class switching. Class switching is the change of one antibody class to another. While the class of\\nantibody changes, the specificity and the antigen-binding sites do not. Thus, the antibodies made are still specific to\\nthe pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response.\\nIgG is a major antibody of late primary responses and the main antibody of secondary responses in the blood. This\\nis because class switching occurs during primary responses. IgG is a monomeric antibody that clears pathogens\\nfrom the blood and can activate complement proteins (although not as well as IgM), taking advantage of its\\nantibacterial activities. Furthermore, this class of antibody is the one that crosses the placenta to protect the\\ndeveloping fetus from disease exits the blood to the interstitial fluid to fight extracellular pathogens.\\nIgA exists in two forms, a four-chain monomer in the blood and an eight-chain structure, or dimer, in exocrine gland\\nsecretions of the mucous membranes, including mucus, saliva, and tears. Thus, dimeric IgA is the only antibody to\\nleave the interior of the body to protect body surfaces. IgA is also of importance to newborns, because this antibody\\nis present in mother’s breast milk (colostrum), which serves to protect the infant from disease.\\nIgE is usually associated with allergies and anaphylaxis. It is present in the lowest concentration in the blood,\\nbecause its Fc region binds strongly to an IgE-specific Fc receptor on the surfaces of mast cells. IgE makes mast cell\\ndegranulation very specific, such that if a person is allergic to peanuts, there will be peanut-specific IgE bound to\\ntheir mast cells. In this person, eating peanuts will cause the mast cells to degranulate, sometimes causing severe\\nallergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, a severe, systemic allergic response that can cause death.\\nClonal Selection of B Cells\\nClonal selection and expansion work much the same way in B cells as in T cells. Only B cells with appropriate\\nantigen specificity are selected for and expanded (Figure 21.23). Eventually, the plasma cells secrete antibodies\\nwith antigenic specificity identical to those that were on the surfaces of the selected B cells.

Both active and passive\\nimmunity have examples in the natural world and as part of medicine.\\nActive immunity is the resistance to pathogens acquired during an adaptive immune response within an individual\\n(Table 21.6). Naturally acquired active immunity, the response to a pathogen, is the focus of this chapter. Artificially\\nacquired active immunity involves the use of vaccines. A vaccine is a killed or weakened pathogen or its components\\nthat, when administered to a healthy individual, leads to the development of immunological memory (a weakened\\nprimary immune response) without causing much in the way of symptoms. Thus, with the use of vaccines, one can\\navoid the damage from disease that results from the first exposure to the pathogen, yet reap the benefits of\\nprotection from immunological memory. The advent of vaccines was one of the major medical advances of the\\ntwentieth century and led to the eradication of smallpox and the control of many infectious diseases, including polio,\\nmeasles, and whooping cough.\\nActive versus Passive Immunity\\nNatural Artificial\\nActive Adaptive immune response Vaccine response\\nPassive Trans-placental antibodies/breastfeeding Immune globulin injections\\nTABLE 21.6\\nPassive immunity arises from the transfer of antibodies to an individual without requiring them to mount their own\\nactive immune response. Naturally acquired passive immunity is seen during fetal development. IgG is transferred\\nfrom the maternal circulation to the fetus via the placenta, protecting the fetus from infection and protecting the\\nnewborn for the first few months of its life. As already stated, a newborn benefits from the IgA antibodies it obtains\\nfrom milk during breastfeeding. The fetus and newborn thus benefit from the immunological memory based on the\\npathogens to which the pregnant person has been exposed. In medicine, artificially acquired passive immunity\\nusually involves injections of immunoglobulins, taken from animals previously exposed to a specific pathogen. This\\ntreatment is a fast-acting method of temporarily protecting an individual who was possibly exposed to a pathogen.\\nThe downside to both types of passive immunity is the lack of the development of immunological memory. Once the\\nantibodies are transferred, they are effective for only a limited time before they degrade.\\n21.4 • The Adaptive Immune Response: B-lymphocytes and Antibodies 925'),\n",

Watch this video\\n(http://openstax.org/l/immunity) to see an animated discussion of passive and active immunity. What is an example\\nof natural immunity acquired passively?\\nT cell-dependent versus T cell-independent Antigens\\nAs discussed previously, Th2 cells secrete cytokines that drive the production of antibodies in a B cell, responding to\\ncomplex antigens such as those made by proteins. On the other hand, some antigens are T cell independent. A T\\ncell-independent antigen usually is in the form of repeated carbohydrate moieties found on the cell walls of\\nbacteria. Each antibody on the B cell surface has two binding sites, and the repeated nature of T cell-independent\\nantigen leads to crosslinking of the surface antibodies on the B cell. The crosslinking is enough to activate it in the\\nabsence of T cell cytokines.\\nA T cell-dependent antigen, on the other hand, usually is not repeated to the same degree on the pathogen and\\nthus does not crosslink surface antibody with the same efficiency. To elicit a response to such antigens, the B and T\\ncells must come close together (Figure 21.25). The B cell must receive two signals to become activated. Its surface\\nimmunoglobulin must recognize native antigen. Some of this antigen is internalized, processed, and presented to\\nthe Th2 cells on a class II MHC molecule. The T cell then binds using its antigen receptor and is activated to secrete\\ncytokines that diffuse to the B cell, finally activating it completely. Thus, the B cell receives signals from both its\\nsurface antibody and the T cell via its cytokines, and acts as a professional antigen-presenting cell in the process.\\nFIGURE 21.25 T and B Cell Binding To elicit a response to a T cell-dependent antigen, the B and T cells must come close together. To\\nbecome fully activated, the B cell must receive two signals from the native antigen and the T cell’s cytokines.\\n21.5 The Immune Response against Pathogens\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the development of immunological competence\\n• Describe the mucosal immune response\\n• Discuss immune responses against bacterial, viral, fungal, and animal pathogens\\n• Describe different ways pathogens evade immune responses\\nNow that you understand the development of mature, naïve B cells and T cells, and some of their major functions,\\nhow do all of these various cells, proteins, and cytokines come together to actually resolve an infection? Ideally, the\\nimmune response will rid the body of a pathogen entirely. The adaptive immune response, with its rapid clonal\\nexpansion, is well suited to this purpose. Think of a primary infection as a race between the pathogen and the\\nimmune system. The pathogen bypasses barrier defenses and starts multiplying in the host’s body. During the first 4\\nto 5 days, the innate immune response will partially control, but not stop, pathogen growth. As the adaptive immune\\nresponse gears up, however, it will begin to clear the pathogen from the body, while at the same time becoming\\nstronger and stronger. When following antibody responses in patients with a particular disease such as a virus, this\\nclearance is referred to as seroconversion (sero- = “serum”). Seroconversion is the reciprocal relationship between\\nvirus levels in the blood and antibody levels. As the antibody levels rise, the virus levels decline, and this is a sign\\nthat the immune response is being at least partially effective (partially, because in many diseases, seroconversion\\n926 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Notice that antibodies are made\\nearly in this disease, and the increase in anti-HIV antibodies correlates with a decrease in detectable virus in the\\nblood. Although these antibodies are an important marker for diagnosing the disease, they are not sufficient to\\ncompletely clear the virus. Several years later, the vast majority of these individuals, if untreated, will lose their\\nentire adaptive immune response, including the ability to make antibodies, during the final stages of AIDS.\\nFIGURE 21.26 HIV Disease Progression Seroconversion, the rise of anti-HIV antibody levels and the concomitant decline in\\nmeasurable virus levels, happens during the first several months of HIV disease. Unfortunately, this antibody response is ineffective at\\ncontrolling the disease, as seen by the progression of the disease towards AIDS, in which all adaptive immune responses are compromised.\\nThe Mucosal Immune Response\\nMucosal tissues are major barriers to the entry of pathogens into the body. The IgA (and sometimes IgM) antibodies\\nin mucus and other secretions can bind to the pathogen, and in the cases of many viruses and bacteria, neutralize\\nthem. Neutralization is the process of coating a pathogen with antibodies, making it physically impossible for the\\nEveryday Connection\\nDisinfectants: Fighting the Good Fight?\\n“Wash your hands!” Parents have been telling their children this for generations. Dirty hands can spread\\ndisease. But is it possible to get rid of enough pathogens that children will never get sick? Are children who avoid\\nexposure to pathogens better off? The answers to both these questions appears to be no.\\nAntibacterial wipes, soaps, gels, and even toys with antibacterial substances embedded in their plastic are\\nubiquitous in our society. Still, these products do not rid the skin and gastrointestinal tract of bacteria, and it\\nwould be harmful to our health if they did. We need these nonpathogenic bacteria on and within our bodies to\\nkeep the pathogenic ones from growing. The urge to keep children perfectly clean is thus probably misguided.\\nChildren will get sick anyway, and the later benefits of immunological memory far outweigh the minor\\ndiscomforts of most childhood diseases. In fact, getting diseases such as chickenpox or measles later in life is\\nmuch harder on the adult and are associated with symptoms significantly worse than those seen in the\\nchildhood illnesses. Of course, vaccinations help children avoid some illnesses, but there are so many\\npathogens, we will never be immune to them all.\\nCould over-cleanliness be the reason that allergies are increasing in more developed countries? Some scientists\\nthink so. Allergies are based on an IgE antibody response. Many scientists think the system evolved to help the\\nbody rid itself of worm parasites. The hygiene theory is the idea that the immune system is geared to respond to\\nantigens, and if pathogens are not present, it will respond instead to inappropriate antigens such as allergens\\nand self-antigens. This is one explanation for the rising incidence of allergies in developed countries, where the\\nresponse to nonpathogens like pollen, shrimp, and cat dander cause allergic responses while not serving any\\nprotective function.\\n21.5 • The Immune Response against Pathogens 927'),\n",

Neutralization, which occurs in the blood, lymph, and other body fluids and\\nsecretions, protects the body constantly. Neutralizing antibodies are the basis for the disease protection offered by\\nvaccines. Vaccinations for diseases that commonly enter the body via mucous membranes, such as influenza, are\\nusually formulated to enhance IgA production.\\nImmune responses in some mucosal tissues such as the Peyer’s patches (see Figure 21.11) in the small intestine\\ntake up particulate antigens by specialized cells known as microfold or M cells (Figure 21.27). These cells allow the\\nbody to sample potential pathogens from the intestinal lumen. Dendritic cells then take the antigen to the regional\\nlymph nodes, where an immune response is mounted.\\nFIGURE 21.27 IgA Immunity The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer’s patches of the small intestine generate IgA immunity.\\nBoth use M cells to transport antigen inside the body so that immune responses can be mounted.\\nDefenses against Bacteria and Fungi\\nThe body fights bacterial pathogens with a wide variety of immunological mechanisms, essentially trying to find one\\nthat is effective. Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of leprosy, are resistant to lysosomal enzymes\\nand can persist in macrophage organelles or escape into the cytosol. In such situations, infected macrophages\\nreceiving cytokine signals from Th1 cells turn on special metabolic pathways. Macrophage oxidative metabolism is\\nhostile to intracellular bacteria, often relying on the production of nitric oxide to kill the bacteria inside the\\nmacrophage.\\nFungal infections, such as those from Aspergillus, Candida, and Pneumocystis, are largely opportunistic infections\\nthat take advantage of suppressed immune responses. Most of the same immune mechanisms effective against\\nbacteria have similar effects on fungi, both of which have characteristic cell wall structures that protect their cells.\\nDefenses against Parasites\\nWorm parasites such as helminths are seen as the primary reason why the mucosal immune response, IgE-\\nmediated allergy and asthma, and eosinophils evolved. These parasites were at one time very common in human\\n928 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

When infecting a human, often via contaminated food, some worms take up residence in the gastrointestinal\\ntract. Eosinophils are attracted to the site by T cell cytokines, which release their granule contents upon their arrival.\\nMast cell degranulation also occurs, and the fluid leakage caused by the increase in local vascular permeability is\\nthought to have a flushing action on the parasite, expelling its larvae from the body. Furthermore, if IgE labels the\\nparasite, the eosinophils can bind to it by its Fc receptor.\\nDefenses against Viruses\\nThe primary mechanisms against viruses are NK cells, interferons, and cytotoxic T cells. Antibodies are effective\\nagainst viruses mostly during protection, where an immune individual can neutralize them based on a previous\\nexposure. Antibodies have no effect on viruses or other intracellular pathogens once they enter the cell, since\\nantibodies are not able to penetrate the plasma membrane of the cell. Many cells respond to viral infections by\\ndownregulating their expression of MHC class I molecules. This is to the advantage of the virus, because without\\nclass I expression, cytotoxic T cells have no activity. NK cells, however, can recognize virally infected class I-\\nnegative cells and destroy them. Thus, NK and cytotoxic T cells have complementary activities against virally\\ninfected cells.\\nInterferons have activity in slowing viral replication and are used in the treatment of certain viral diseases, such as\\nhepatitis B and C, but their ability to eliminate the virus completely is limited. The cytotoxic T cell response, though,\\nis key, as it eventually overwhelms the virus and kills infected cells before the virus can complete its replicative\\ncycle. Clonal expansion and the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill more than one target cell make these cells\\nespecially effective against viruses. In fact, without cytotoxic T cells, it is likely that humans would all die at some\\npoint from a viral infection (if no vaccine were available).\\nEvasion of the Immune System by Pathogens\\nIt is important to keep in mind that although the immune system has evolved to be able to control many pathogens,\\npathogens themselves have evolved ways to evade the immune response. An example already mentioned is in\\nMycobacterium tuberculosis, which has evolved a complex cell wall that is resistant to the digestive enzymes of the\\nmacrophages that ingest them, and thus persists in the host, causing the chronic disease tuberculosis. This section\\nbriefly summarizes other ways in which pathogens can “outwit” immune responses. But keep in mind, although it\\nseems as if pathogens have a will of their own, they do not. All of these evasive “strategies” arose strictly by\\nevolution, driven by selection.\\nBacteria sometimes evade immune responses because they exist in multiple strains, such as different groups of\\nStaphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is commonly found in minor skin infections, such as boils, and some healthy\\npeople harbor it in their nose. One small group of strains of this bacterium, however, called methicillin-resistant\\nStaphylococcus aureus, has become resistant to multiple antibiotics and is essentially untreatable. Different\\nbacterial strains differ in the antigens on their surfaces. The immune response against one strain (antigen) does not\\naffect the other; thus, the species survives.\\nAnother method of immune evasion is mutation. Because viruses’ surface molecules mutate continuously, viruses\\nlike influenza change enough each year that the flu vaccine for one year may not protect against the flu common to\\nthe next. New vaccine formulations must be derived for each flu season.\\nGenetic recombination—the combining of gene segments from two different pathogens—is an efficient form of\\nimmune evasion. For example, the influenza virus contains gene segments that can recombine when two different\\nviruses infect the same cell. Recombination between human and pig influenza viruses led to the 2010 H1N1 swine\\nflu outbreak.\\nPathogens can produce immunosuppressive molecules that impair immune function, and there are several different\\ntypes. Viruses are especially good at evading the immune response in this way, and many types of viruses have been\\nshown to suppress the host immune response in ways much more subtle than the wholesale destruction caused by\\nHIV.\\n21.5 • The Immune Response against Pathogens 929'),\n",

When it goes haywire, and becomes too weak or too\\nstrong, it leads to a state of disease. The factors that maintain immunological homeostasis are complex and\\nincompletely understood.\\nImmunodeficiencies\\nAs you have seen, the immune system is quite complex. It has many pathways using many cell types and signals.\\nBecause it is so complex, there are many ways for it to go wrong. Inherited immunodeficiencies arise from gene\\nmutations that affect specific components of the immune response. There are also acquired immunodeficiencies\\nwith potentially devastating effects on the immune system, such as HIV.\\nInherited Immunodeficiencies\\nA list of all inherited immunodeficiencies is well beyond the scope of this book. The list is almost as long as the list\\nof cells, proteins, and signaling molecules of the immune system itself. Some deficiencies, such as those for\\ncomplement, cause only a higher susceptibility to some Gram-negative bacteria. Others are more severe in their\\nconsequences. Certainly, the most serious of the inherited immunodeficiencies is severe combined\\nimmunodeficiency disease (SCID). This disease is complex because it is caused by many different genetic defects.\\nWhat groups them together is the fact that both the B cell and T cell arms of the adaptive immune response are\\naffected.\\nChildren with this disease usually die of opportunistic infections within their first year of life unless they receive a\\nbone marrow transplant. Such a procedure had not yet been perfected for David Vetter, the “boy in the bubble,” who\\nwas treated for SCID by having to live almost his entire life in a sterile plastic cocoon for the 12 years before his\\ndeath from infection in 1984. One of the features that make bone marrow transplants work as well as they do is the\\nproliferative capability of hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. Only a small amount of bone marrow from a\\nhealthy donor is given intravenously to the recipient. It finds its own way to the bone where it populates it,\\neventually reconstituting the patient’s immune system, which is usually destroyed beforehand by treatment with\\nradiation or chemotherapeutic drugs.\\nNew treatments for SCID using gene therapy, inserting nondefective genes into cells taken from the patient and\\ngiving them back, have the advantage of not needing the tissue match required for standard transplants. Although\\nnot a standard treatment, this approach holds promise, especially for those in whom standard bone marrow\\ntransplantation has failed.\\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus/AIDS\\nAlthough many viruses cause suppression of the immune system, only one wipes it out completely, and that is the\\npreviously mentioned HIV. It is worth discussing the biology of this virus, which can lead to the well-known AIDS, so\\nthat its full effects on the immune system can be understood. The virus is transmitted through semen, vaginal fluids,\\nand blood, and can be caught by risky sexual behaviors and the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users. There\\nare sometimes, but not always, flu-like symptoms in the first 1 to 2 weeks after infection. This is later followed by\\nseroconversion. The anti-HIV antibodies formed during seroconversion are the basis for most initial HIV screening\\ndone in the United States. Because seroconversion takes different lengths of time in different individuals, multiple\\nAIDS tests are given months apart to confirm or eliminate the possibility of infection.\\nAfter seroconversion, the amount of virus circulating in the blood drops and stays at a low level for several years.\\nDuring this time, the levels of CD4+ cells, especially helper T cells, decline steadily, until at some point, the immune\\nresponse is so weak that opportunistic disease and eventually death result. HIV uses CD4 as the receptor to get\\ninside cells, but it also needs a co-receptor, such as CCR5 or CXCR4. These co-receptors, which usually bind to\\nchemokines, present another target for anti-HIV drug development. Although other antigen-presenting cells are\\n930 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

By targeting the virus itself and sparing the cells, this approach\\nhas been successful in significantly prolonging the lives of HIV-positive individuals. On the other hand, an HIV\\nvaccine has been 30 years in development and is still years away. Because the virus mutates rapidly to evade the\\nimmune system, scientists have been looking for parts of the virus that do not change and thus would be good\\ntargets for a vaccine candidate.\\nHypersensitivities\\nThe word “hypersensitivity” simply means sensitive beyond normal levels of activation. Allergies and inflammatory\\nresponses to nonpathogenic environmental substances have been observed since the dawn of history.\\nHypersensitivity is a medical term describing symptoms that are now known to be caused by unrelated mechanisms\\nof immunity. Still, it is useful for this discussion to use the four types of hypersensitivities as a guide to understand\\nthese mechanisms (Figure 21.28).\\nFIGURE 21.28 Immune Hypersensitivity Components of the immune system cause four types of hypersensitivity. Notice that types\\nI–III are B cell mediated, whereas type IV hypersensitivity is exclusively a T cell phenomenon.\\nImmediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity\\nAntigens that cause allergic responses are often referred to as allergens. The specificity of the immediate\\nhypersensitivity response is predicated on the binding of allergen-specific IgE to the mast cell surface. The process\\nof producing allergen-specific IgE is called sensitization, and is a necessary prerequisite for the symptoms of\\nimmediate hypersensitivity to occur. Allergies and allergic asthma are mediated by mast cell degranulation that is\\ncaused by the crosslinking of the antigen-specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface. The mediators released\\nhave various vasoactive effects already discussed, but the major symptoms of inhaled allergens are the nasal edema\\nand runny nose caused by the increased vascular permeability and increased blood flow of nasal blood vessels. As\\nthese mediators are released with mast cell degranulation, type I hypersensitivity reactions are usually rapid and\\noccur within just a few minutes, hence the term immediate hypersensitivity.\\n21.6 • Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses 931'),\n",

Some individuals develop mild allergies,\\nwhich are usually treated with antihistamines. Others develop severe allergies that may cause anaphylactic shock,\\nwhich can potentially be fatal within 20 to 30 minutes if untreated. This drop in blood pressure (shock) with\\naccompanying contractions of bronchial smooth muscle is caused by systemic mast cell degranulation when an\\nallergen is eaten (for example, shellfish and peanuts), injected (by a bee sting or being administered penicillin), or\\ninhaled (asthma). Because epinephrine raises blood pressure and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, it is routinely\\nused to counteract the effects of anaphylaxis and can be lifesaving. Patients with known severe allergies are\\nencouraged to keep automatic epinephrine injectors with them at all times, especially when away from easy access\\nto hospitals.\\nAllergists use skin testing to identify allergens in type I hypersensitivity. In skin testing, allergen extracts are\\ninjected into the epidermis, and a positive result of a soft, pale swelling at the site surrounded by a red zone (called\\nthe wheal and flare response), caused by the release of histamine and the granule mediators, usually occurs within\\n30 minutes. The soft center is due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels and the redness is caused by the increased\\nblood flow to the area that results from the dilation of local blood vessels at the site.\\nType II and Type III Hypersensitivities\\nType II hypersensitivity, which involves IgG-mediated lysis of cells by complement proteins, occurs during\\nmismatched blood transfusions and blood compatibility diseases such as erythroblastosis fetalis (see section on\\ntransplantation). Type III hypersensitivity occurs with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where\\nsoluble antigens, mostly DNA and other material from the nucleus, and antibodies accumulate in the blood to the\\npoint that the antigen and antibody precipitate along blood vessel linings. These immune complexes often lodge in\\nthe kidneys, joints, and other organs where they can activate complement proteins and cause inflammation.\\nDelayed (Type IV) Hypersensitivity\\nDelayed hypersensitivity, or type IV hypersensitivity, is basically a standard cellular immune response. In delayed\\nhypersensitivity, the first exposure to an antigen is called sensitization, such that on re-exposure, a secondary\\ncellular response results, secreting cytokines that recruit macrophages and other phagocytes to the site. These\\nsensitized T cells, of the Th1 class, will also activate cytotoxic T cells. The time it takes for this reaction to occur\\naccounts for the 24- to 72-hour delay in development.\\nThe classical test for delayed hypersensitivity is the tuberculin test for tuberculosis, where bacterial proteins from\\nM. tuberculosis are injected into the skin. A couple of days later, a positive test is indicated by a raised red area that\\nis hard to the touch, called an induration, which is a consequence of the cellular infiltrate, an accumulation of\\nactivated macrophages. A positive tuberculin test means that the patient has been exposed to the bacteria and\\nexhibits a cellular immune response to it.\\nAnother type of delayed hypersensitivity is contact sensitivity, where substances such as the metal nickel cause a\\nred and swollen area upon contact with the skin. The individual must have been previously sensitized to the metal. A\\nmuch more severe case of contact sensitivity is poison ivy, but many of the harshest symptoms of the reaction are\\nassociated with the toxicity of its oils and are not T cell mediated.\\nAutoimmune Responses\\nThe worst cases of the immune system over-reacting are autoimmune diseases. Somehow, tolerance breaks down\\nand the immune systems in individuals with these diseases begin to attack their own bodies, causing significant\\ndamage. The trigger for these diseases is, more often than not, unknown, and the treatments are usually based on\\nresolving the symptoms using immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids. These diseases\\ncan be localized and crippling, as in rheumatoid arthritis, or diffuse in the body with multiple symptoms that differ in\\ndifferent individuals, as is the case with systemic lupus erythematosus (Figure 21.29).\\n932 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

(b) The diagram shows a variety of possible symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus.\\nEnvironmental triggers seem to play large roles in autoimmune responses. One explanation for the breakdown of\\ntolerance is that, after certain bacterial infections, an immune response to a component of the bacterium cross-\\nreacts with a self-antigen. This mechanism is seen in rheumatic fever, a result of infection with Streptococcus\\nbacteria, which causes strep throat. The antibodies to this pathogen’s M protein cross-react with an antigenic\\ncomponent of heart myosin, a major contractile protein of the heart that is critical to its normal function. The\\nantibody binds to these molecules and activates complement proteins, causing damage to the heart, especially to\\nthe heart valves. On the other hand, some theories propose that having multiple common infectious diseases\\nactually prevents autoimmune responses. The fact that autoimmune diseases are rare in countries that have a high\\nincidence of infectious diseases supports this idea, another example of the hygiene hypothesis discussed earlier in\\nthis chapter.\\nThere are genetic factors in autoimmune diseases as well. Some diseases are associated with the MHC genes that\\nan individual expresses. The reason for this association is likely because if one’s MHC molecules are not able to\\npresent a certain self-antigen, then that particular autoimmune disease cannot occur. Overall, there are more than\\n80 different autoimmune diseases, which are a significant health problem in the elderly. Table 21.7 lists several of\\nthe most common autoimmune diseases, the antigens that are targeted, and the segment of the adaptive immune\\nresponse that causes the damage.\\nAutoimmune Diseases\\nDisease Autoantigen Symptoms\\nCeliac disease Tissue transglutaminase Damage to small intestine\\nDiabetes\\nmellitus type I Beta cells of pancreas Low insulin production; inability to\\nregulate serum glucose\\nGraves’\\ndisease\\nThyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (antibody blocks\\nreceptor) Hyperthyroidism\\nHashimoto’s\\nthyroiditis\\nThyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (antibody\\nmimics hormone and stimulates receptor) Hypothyroidism\\nLupus\\nerythematosus Nuclear DNA and proteins Damage of many body systems\\nTABLE 21.7\\n21.6 • Diseases Associated with Depressed or Overactive Immune Responses 933'),\n",

With the use\\nof tissue typing and anti-rejection drugs, transplantation of organs and the control of the anti-transplant immune\\nresponse have made huge strides in the past 50 years. Today, these procedures are commonplace. Tissue typing is\\nthe determination of MHC molecules in the tissue to be transplanted to better match the donor to the recipient. The\\nimmune response to cancer, on the other hand, has been more difficult to understand and control. Although it is\\nclear that the immune system can recognize some cancers and control them, others seem to be resistant to immune\\nmechanisms.\\nThe Rh Factor\\nRed blood cells can be typed based on their surface antigens. ABO blood type, in which individuals are type A, B, AB,\\nor O according to their genetics, is one example. A separate antigen system seen on red blood cells is the Rh\\nantigen. When someone is “A positive” for example, the positive refers to the presence of the Rh antigen, whereas\\nsomeone who is “A negative” would lack this molecule.\\nAn interesting consequence of Rh factor expression is seen in erythroblastosis fetalis, a hemolytic disease of the\\nnewborn (Figure 21.30). This disease occurs when people negative for Rh antigen have multiple Rh-positive\\nchildren. During the birth of a first Rh-positive child, the birth parent makes a primary anti-Rh antibody response to\\nthe fetal blood cells that enter the pregnant person's bloodstream. If the same parent has a second Rh-positive\\nchild, IgG antibodies against Rh-positive blood mounted during this secondary response cross the placenta and\\nattack the fetal blood, causing anemia. This is a consequence of the fact that the fetus is not genetically identical to\\nthe birth parent, and thus the parent is capable of mounting an immune response against it. This disease is treated\\nwith antibodies specific for Rh factor. These are given to the pregnant person during the first and subsequent births,\\ndestroying any fetal blood that might enter their system and preventing the immune response.\\n934 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\"),\n",

During the first birth, fetal blood enters the pregnant\\nperson's circulatory system, and anti-Rh antibodies are made. During the gestation of the second child, these antibodies cross the placenta\\nand attack the blood of the fetus. The treatment for this disease is to give the carrier anti-Rh antibodies (RhoGAM) during the first\\npregnancy to destroy Rh-positive fetal red blood cells from entering their system and causing the anti-Rh antibody response in the first\\nplace.\\nTissue Transplantation\\nTissue transplantation is more complicated than blood transfusions because of two characteristics of MHC\\nmolecules. These molecules are the major cause of transplant rejection (hence the name “histocompatibility”).\\nMHC polygeny refers to the multiple MHC proteins on cells, and MHC polymorphism refers to the multiple alleles\\nfor each individual MHC locus. Thus, there are many alleles in the human population that can be expressed (Table\\n21.8 and Table 21.9). When a donor organ expresses MHC molecules that are different from the recipient, the latter\\nwill often mount a cytotoxic T cell response to the organ and reject it. Histologically, if a biopsy of a transplanted\\norgan exhibits massive infiltration of T lymphocytes within the first weeks after transplant, it is a sign that the\\ntransplant is likely to fail. The response is a classical, and very specific, primary T cell immune response. As far as\\nmedicine is concerned, the immune response in this scenario does the patient no good at all and causes significant\\nharm.\\n21.7 • Transplantation and Cancer Immunology 935\"),\n",

Because the bone marrow cells being transplanted contain lymphocytes capable of\\nmounting an immune response, and because the recipient’s immune response has been destroyed before receiving\\nthe transplant, the donor cells may attack the recipient tissues, causing graft-versus-host disease. Symptoms of\\nthis disease, which usually include a rash and damage to the liver and mucosa, are variable, and attempts have been\\nmade to moderate the disease by first removing mature T cells from the donor bone marrow before transplanting it.\\nImmune Responses Against Cancer\\nIt is clear that with some cancers, for example Kaposi’s sarcoma, a healthy immune system does a good job at\\ncontrolling them (Figure 21.31). This disease, which is caused by the human herpesvirus, is almost never observed\\nin individuals with strong immune systems, such as the young and immunocompetent. Other examples of cancers\\ncaused by viruses include liver cancer caused by the hepatitis B virus and cervical cancer caused by the human\\npapilloma virus. As these last two viruses have vaccines available for them, getting vaccinated can help prevent\\nthese two types of cancer by stimulating the immune response.\\nFIGURE 21.31 Karposi’s Sarcoma Lesions (credit: National Cancer Institute)\\nOn the other hand, as cancer cells are often able to divide and mutate rapidly, they may escape the immune\\nresponse, just as certain pathogens such as HIV do. There are three stages in the immune response to many\\ncancers: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Elimination occurs when the immune response first develops toward\\ntumor-specific antigens specific to the cancer and actively kills most cancer cells, followed by a period of controlled\\nequilibrium during which the remaining cancer cells are held in check. Unfortunately, many cancers mutate, so they\\nno longer express any specific antigens for the immune system to respond to, and a subpopulation of cancer cells\\nescapes the immune response, continuing the disease process.\\nThis fact has led to extensive research in trying to develop ways to enhance the early immune response to\\ncompletely eliminate the early cancer and thus prevent a later escape. One method that has shown some success is\\nthe use of cancer vaccines, which differ from viral and bacterial vaccines in that they are directed against the cells of\\none’s own body. Treated cancer cells are injected into cancer patients to enhance their anti-cancer immune\\nresponse and thereby prolong survival. The immune system has the capability to detect these cancer cells and\\nproliferate faster than the cancer cells do, overwhelming the cancer in a similar way as they do for viruses. Cancer\\nvaccines have been developed for malignant melanoma, a highly fatal skin cancer, and renal (kidney) cell carcinoma.\\nThese vaccines are still in the development stages, but some positive and encouraging results have been obtained\\nclinically.\\nIt is tempting to focus on the complexity of the immune system and the problems it causes as a negative. The\\nupside to immunity, however, is so much greater: The benefit of staying alive far outweighs the negatives caused\\nwhen the system does sometimes go awry. Working on “autopilot,” the immune system helps to maintain your\\nhealth and kill pathogens. The only time you really miss the immune response is when it is not being effective and\\nillness results, or, as in the extreme case of HIV disease, the immune system is gone completely.\\n21.7 • Transplantation and Cancer Immunology 937'),\n",

After all, it has to protect the entire body from infection. Therefore,\\nthe immune system is required to interact with other organ systems, sometimes in complex ways. Thirty years of\\nresearch focusing on the connections between the immune system, the central nervous system, and the\\nendocrine system have led to a new science with the unwieldy name of called psychoneuroimmunology. The\\nphysical connections between these systems have been known for centuries: All primary and secondary organs\\nare connected to sympathetic nerves. What is more complex, though, is the interaction of neurotransmitters,\\nhormones, cytokines, and other soluble signaling molecules, and the mechanism of “crosstalk” between the\\nsystems. For example, white blood cells, including lymphocytes and phagocytes, have receptors for various\\nneurotransmitters released by associated neurons. Additionally, hormones such as cortisol (naturally produced\\nby the adrenal cortex) and prednisone (synthetic) are well known for their abilities to suppress T cell immune\\nmechanisms, hence, their prominent use in medicine as long-term, anti-inflammatory drugs.\\nOne well-established interaction of the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems is the effect of stress on\\nimmune health. In the human vertebrate evolutionary past, stress was associated with the fight-or-flight\\nresponse, largely mediated by the central nervous system and the adrenal medulla. This stress was necessary\\nfor survival. The physical action of fighting or running, whichever the animal decides, usually resolves the\\nproblem in one way or another. On the other hand, there are no physical actions to resolve most modern day\\nstresses, including short-term stressors like taking examinations and long-term stressors such as being\\nunemployed or losing a spouse. The effect of stress can be felt by nearly every organ system, and the immune\\nsystem is no exception (Table 21.10).\\nEffects of Stress on Body Systems\\nSystem Stress-related illness\\nIntegumentary system Acne, rashes, irritation\\nNervous system Headaches, depression, anxiety, irritability, loss of appetite, lack of motivation,\\nreduced mental performance\\nMuscular and skeletal\\nsystems Muscle and joint pain, neck and shoulder pain\\nCirculatory system Increased heart rate, hypertension, increased probability of heart attacks\\nDigestive system Indigestion, heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, weight gain\\nor loss\\nImmune system Depressed ability to fight infections\\nMale reproductive\\nsystem Lowered sperm production, impotence, reduced sexual desire\\nFemale reproductive\\nsystem Irregular menstrual cycle, reduced sexual desire\\nTABLE 21.10\\n938 21 • The Lymphatic and Immune System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

First, most short-term stress does not impair the immune\\nsystem in healthy individuals enough to lead to a greater incidence of diseases. However, older individuals and\\nthose with suppressed immune responses due to disease or immunosuppressive drugs may respond even to\\nshort-term stressors by getting sicker more often. It has been found that short-term stress diverts the body’s\\nresources towards enhancing innate immune responses, which have the ability to act fast and would seem to\\nhelp the body prepare better for possible infections associated with the trauma that may result from a fight-or-\\nflight exchange. The diverting of resources away from the adaptive immune response, however, causes its own\\nshare of problems in fighting disease.\\nChronic stress, unlike short-term stress, may inhibit immune responses even in otherwise healthy adults. The\\nsuppression of both innate and adaptive immune responses is clearly associated with increases in some\\ndiseases, as seen when individuals lose a spouse or have other long-term stresses, such as taking care of a\\nspouse with a fatal disease or dementia.

Additionally, interferons are induced\\nthat protect cells from viruses in their vicinity. Finally,\\nthe innate immune response does not stop when the\\nadaptive immune response is developed. In fact, both\\ncan cooperate and one can influence the other in their\\nresponses against pathogens.\\n21.3 The Adaptive Immune Response: T\\nlymphocytes and Their Functional Types\\nT cells recognize antigens with their antigen receptor, a\\ncomplex of two protein chains on their surface. They do\\nnot recognize self-antigens, however, but only\\nprocessed antigen presented on their surfaces in a\\nbinding groove of a major histocompatibility complex\\nmolecule. T cells develop in the thymus, where they\\nlearn to use self-MHC molecules to recognize only\\nforeign antigens, thus making them tolerant to self-\\nantigens. There are several functional types of T\\nlymphocytes, the major ones being helper, regulatory,\\nand cytotoxic T cells.\\n21.4 The Adaptive Immune Response: B-\\nlymphocytes and Antibodies\\nB cells, which develop within the bone marrow, are\\nresponsible for making five different classes of\\nantibodies, each with its own functions. B cells have\\ntheir own mechanisms for tolerance, but in peripheral\\ntolerance, the B cells that leave the bone marrow\\nremain inactive due to T cell tolerance. Some B cells do\\nnot need T cell cytokines to make antibody, and they\\nbypass this need by the crosslinking of their surface\\nimmunoglobulin by repeated carbohydrate residues\\nfound in the cell walls of many bacterial species.\\nOthers require T cells to become activated.\\n21.5 The Immune Response against\\nPathogens\\nEarly childhood is a time when the body develops\\nmuch of its immunological memory that protects it\\nfrom diseases in adulthood. The components of the\\nimmune response that have the maximum\\neffectiveness against a pathogen are often associated\\nwith the class of pathogen involved. Bacteria and fungi\\nare especially susceptible to damage by complement\\nproteins, whereas viruses are taken care of by\\ninterferons and cytotoxic T cells. Worms are attacked\\nby eosinophils. Pathogens have shown the ability,\\nhowever, to evade the body’s immune responses, some\\nleading to chronic infections or even death. The\\nimmune system and pathogens are in a slow,\\nevolutionary race to see who stays on top. Modern\\nmedicine, hopefully, will keep the results skewed in\\nhumans’ favor.\\n21.6 Diseases Associated with Depressed\\nor Overactive Immune Responses\\nThe immune response can be under-reactive or over-\\nreactive. Suppressed immunity can result from\\ninherited genetic defects or by acquiring viruses. Over-\\nreactive immune responses include the\\nhypersensitivities: B cell- and T cell-mediated immune\\nresponses designed to control pathogens, but that lead\\nto symptoms or medical complications. The worst\\ncases of over-reactive immune responses are\\nautoimmune diseases, where an individual’s immune\\nsystem attacks their own body because of the\\nbreakdown of immunological tolerance. These\\ndiseases are more common in the aged, so treating\\nthem will be a challenge in the future as the aged\\npopulation in the world increases.\\n21.7 Transplantation and Cancer\\nImmunology\\nBlood transfusion and organ transplantation both\\nrequire an understanding of the immune response to\\nprevent medical complications. Blood needs to be\\ntyped so that natural antibodies against mismatched\\nblood will not destroy it, causing more harm than good\\nto the recipient. Transplanted organs must be matched\\nby their MHC molecules and, with the use of\\nimmunosuppressive drugs, can be successful even if an\\nexact tissue match cannot be made. Another aspect to\\nthe immune response is its ability to control and\\neradicate cancer. Although this has been shown to\\noccur with some rare cancers and those caused by\\nknown viruses, the normal immune response to most\\ncancers is not sufficient to control cancer growth. Thus,\\ncancer vaccines designed to enhance these immune\\nresponses show promise for certain types of cancer.\\nInteractive Link Questions\\n1.

Really! See how long you can hold your breath as you continue reading…How\\nlong can you do it? Chances are you are feeling uncomfortable already. A typical human cannot survive without\\nbreathing for more than 3 minutes, and even if you wanted to hold your breath longer, your autonomic nervous\\nsystem would take control. This is because every cell in the body needs to run the oxidative stages of cellular\\nrespiration, the process by which energy is produced in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For oxidative\\nphosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may\\nbe surprised to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually the accumulation of carbon dioxide\\nthat primarily drives your need to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory\\nsystem, which includes muscles to move air into and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and\\nmicroscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The circulatory system transports gases from the lungs to\\ntissues throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect the respiratory system, such as asthma,\\nemphysema, chronic obstruction pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of these conditions affect the gas\\nexchange process and result in labored breathing and other difficulties.\\nFigure 22.1 Mountain Climbers The thin air at high elevations can strain the human respiratory system.

Portions of the\\nrespiratory system are also used for non-vital functions, such as sensing odors, speech production, and for straining,\\nsuch as during childbirth or coughing (Figure 22.2).\\nFIGURE 22.2 Major Respiratory Structures The major respiratory structures span the nasal cavity to the diaphragm.\\nFunctionally, the respiratory system can be divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone. The conducting\\nzone of the respiratory system includes the organs and structures not directly involved in gas exchange. The gas\\nexchange occurs in the respiratory zone.\\nConducting Zone\\nThe major functions of the conducting zone are to provide a route for incoming and outgoing air, remove debris and\\npathogens from the incoming air, and warm and humidify the incoming air. Several structures within the conducting\\nzone perform other functions as well. The epithelium of the nasal passages, for example, is essential to sensing\\nodors, and the bronchial epithelium that lines the lungs can metabolize some airborne carcinogens.\\nThe Nose and its Adjacent Structures\\nThe major entrance and exit for the respiratory system is through the nose. When discussing the nose, it is helpful to\\ndivide it into two major sections: the external nose, and the nasal cavity or internal nose.\\nThe external nose consists of the surface and skeletal structures that result in the outward appearance of the nose\\nand contribute to its numerous functions (Figure 22.3). The root is the region of the nose located between the\\neyebrows. The bridge is the part of the nose that connects the root to the rest of the nose. The dorsum nasi is the\\nlength of the nose. The apex is the tip of the nose. On either side of the apex, the nostrils are formed by the alae\\n(singular = ala). An ala is a cartilaginous structure that forms the lateral side of each naris (plural = nares), or nostril\\nopening. The philtrum is the concave surface that connects the apex of the nose to the upper lip.\\n948 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

While the root and\\nbridge of the nose consist of bone, the protruding portion of the nose is composed of cartilage. As a result, when\\nlooking at a skull, the nose is missing. The nasal bone is one of a pair of bones that lies under the root and bridge of\\nthe nose. The nasal bone articulates superiorly with the frontal bone and laterally with the maxillary bones. Septal\\ncartilage is flexible hyaline cartilage connected to the nasal bone, forming the dorsum nasi. The alar cartilage\\nconsists of the apex of the nose; it surrounds the naris.\\nThe nares open into the nasal cavity, which is separated into left and right sections by the nasal septum (Figure\\n22.4). The nasal septum is formed anteriorly by a portion of the septal cartilage (the flexible portion you can touch\\nwith your fingers) and posteriorly by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (a cranial bone located just\\nposterior to the nasal bones) and the thin vomer bones (whose name refers to its plough shape). Each lateral wall of\\nthe nasal cavity has three bony projections, called the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae. The inferior\\nconchae are separate bones, whereas the superior and middle conchae are portions of the ethmoid bone. Conchae\\nserve to increase the surface area of the nasal cavity and to disrupt the flow of air as it enters the nose, causing air\\nto bounce along the epithelium, where it is cleaned and warmed. The conchae and meatuses also conserve water\\nand prevent dehydration of the nasal epithelium by trapping water during exhalation. The floor of the nasal cavity is\\ncomposed of the palate. The hard palate at the anterior region of the nasal cavity is composed of bone. The soft\\npalate at the posterior portion of the nasal cavity consists of muscle tissue. Air exits the nasal cavities via the\\ninternal nares and moves into the pharynx.\\n22.1 • Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System 949'),\n",

The cilia of the respiratory epithelium help remove the mucus and\\ndebris from the nasal cavity with a constant beating motion, sweeping materials towards the throat to be swallowed.\\nInterestingly, cold air slows the movement of the cilia, resulting in accumulation of mucus that may in turn lead to a\\nrunny nose during cold weather. This moist epithelium functions to warm and humidify incoming air. Capillaries\\nlocated just beneath the nasal epithelium warm the air by convection. Serous and mucus-producing cells also\\nsecrete the lysozyme enzyme and proteins called defensins, which have antibacterial properties.

At the top of the\\nnasopharynx are the pharyngeal tonsils. A pharyngeal tonsil, also called an adenoid, is an aggregate of lymphoid\\nreticular tissue similar to a lymph node that lies at the superior portion of the nasopharynx. The function of the\\npharyngeal tonsil is not well understood, but it contains a rich supply of lymphocytes and is covered with ciliated\\nepithelium that traps and destroys invading pathogens that enter during inhalation. The pharyngeal tonsils are large\\nin children, but interestingly, tend to regress with age and may even disappear. The uvula is a small bulbous,\\nteardrop-shaped structure located at the apex of the soft palate. Both the uvula and soft palate move like a\\npendulum during swallowing, swinging upward to close off the nasopharynx to prevent ingested materials from\\nentering the nasal cavity. In addition, auditory (Eustachian) tubes that connect to each middle ear cavity open into\\nthe nasopharynx. This connection is why colds often lead to ear infections.\\nThe oropharynx is a passageway for both air and food. The oropharynx is bordered superiorly by the nasopharynx\\nand anteriorly by the oral cavity. The fauces is the opening at the connection between the oral cavity and the\\noropharynx. As the nasopharynx becomes the oropharynx, the epithelium changes from pseudostratified ciliated\\ncolumnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium. The oropharynx contains two distinct sets of tonsils, the\\npalatine and lingual tonsils. A palatine tonsil is one of a pair of structures located laterally in the oropharynx in the\\narea of the fauces. The lingual tonsil is located at the base of the tongue. Similar to the pharyngeal tonsil, the\\npalatine and lingual tonsils are composed of lymphoid tissue, and trap and destroy pathogens entering the body\\nthrough the oral or nasal cavities.\\nThe laryngopharynx is inferior to the oropharynx and posterior to the larynx. It continues the route for ingested\\nmaterial and air until its inferior end, where the digestive and respiratory systems diverge. The stratified squamous\\nepithelium of the oropharynx is continuous with the laryngopharynx. Anteriorly, the laryngopharynx opens into the\\nlarynx, whereas posteriorly, it enters the esophagus.\\nLarynx\\nThe larynx is a cartilaginous structure inferior to the laryngopharynx that connects the pharynx to the trachea and\\nhelps regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves the lungs (Figure 22.7). The structure of the larynx is formed\\nby several pieces of cartilage. Three large cartilage pieces—the thyroid cartilage (anterior), epiglottis (superior), and\\ncricoid cartilage (inferior)—form the major structure of the larynx. The thyroid cartilage is the largest piece of\\ncartilage that makes up the larynx. The thyroid cartilage consists of the laryngeal prominence, or “Adam’s apple,”\\nwhich tends to be more prominent in males. The thick cricoid cartilage forms a ring, with a wide posterior region\\nand a thinner anterior region. Three smaller, paired cartilages—the arytenoids, corniculates, and cuneiforms—attach\\nto the epiglottis and the vocal cords and muscle that help move the vocal cords to produce speech.\\n952 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

When in the “closed” position, the unattached end of the epiglottis rests on the\\nglottis. The glottis is composed of the vestibular folds, the true vocal cords, and the space between these folds\\n(Figure 22.8). A vestibular fold, or false vocal cord, is one of a pair of folded sections of mucous membrane. A true\\nvocal cord is one of the white, membranous folds attached by muscle to the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages of the\\nlarynx on their outer edges. The inner edges of the true vocal cords are free, allowing oscillation to produce sound.\\nThe size of the membranous folds of the true vocal cords differs between individuals, producing voices with different\\npitch ranges. Folds in males tend to be larger than those in females, which create a deeper voice. The act of\\nswallowing causes the pharynx and larynx to lift upward, allowing the pharynx to expand and the epiglottis of the\\nlarynx to swing downward, closing the opening to the trachea.

Rings of cartilage, similar to those of the trachea, support the structure of the bronchi and prevent\\ntheir collapse. The primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum, a concave region where blood vessels, lymphatic\\nvessels, and nerves also enter the lungs. The bronchi continue to branch into a bronchial tree. A bronchial tree (or\\nrespiratory tree) is the collective term used for these multiple-branched bronchi. The main function of the bronchi,\\nlike other conducting zone structures, is to provide a passageway for air to move into and out of each lung. In\\naddition, the mucous membrane traps debris and pathogens.\\nA bronchiole branches from the tertiary bronchi. Bronchioles, which are about 1 mm in diameter, further branch\\nuntil they become the tiny terminal bronchioles, which lead to the structures of gas exchange. There are more than\\n1000 terminal bronchioles in each lung. The muscular walls of the bronchioles do not contain cartilage like those of\\nthe bronchi. This muscular wall can change the size of the tubing to increase or decrease airflow through the tube.\\nRespiratory Zone\\nIn contrast to the conducting zone, the respiratory zone includes structures that are directly involved in gas\\nexchange. The respiratory zone begins where the terminal bronchioles join a respiratory bronchiole, the smallest\\ntype of bronchiole (Figure 22.10), which then leads to an alveolar duct, opening into a cluster of alveoli.\\n22.1 • Organs and Structures of the Respiratory System 955'),\n",

To this end, the lungs exchange respiratory gases across a very large epithelial surface area—about 70\\nsquare meters—that is highly permeable to gases.\\nGross Anatomy of the Lungs\\nThe lungs are pyramid-shaped, paired organs that are connected to the trachea by the right and left bronchi; on the\\ninferior surface, the lungs are bordered by the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle located at the\\nbase of the lungs and thoracic cavity. The lungs are enclosed by the pleurae, which are attached to the mediastinum.\\nThe right lung is shorter and wider than the left lung, and the left lung occupies a smaller volume than the right. The\\ncardiac notch is an indentation on the surface of the left lung, and it allows space for the heart (Figure 22.13). The\\napex of the lung is the superior region, whereas the base is the opposite region near the diaphragm. The costal\\nsurface of the lung borders the ribs. The mediastinal surface faces the midline.\\nFIGURE 22.13 Gross Anatomy of the Lungs\\nEach lung is composed of smaller units called lobes. Fissures separate these lobes from each other. The right lung\\nconsists of three lobes: the superior, middle, and inferior lobes. The left lung consists of two lobes: the superior and\\ninferior lobes. A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lobe, and each lobe houses multiple\\nbronchopulmonary segments. Each segment receives air from its own tertiary bronchus and is supplied with blood\\nby its own artery. Some diseases of the lungs typically affect one or more bronchopulmonary segments, and in some\\ncases, the diseased segments can be surgically removed with little influence on neighboring segments. A pulmonary\\nlobule is a subdivision formed as the bronchi branch into bronchioles. Each lobule receives its own large bronchiole\\nthat has multiple branches. An interlobular septum is a wall, composed of connective tissue, which separates\\nlobules from one another.\\nBlood Supply and Nervous Innervation of the Lungs\\nThe blood supply of the lungs plays an important role in gas exchange and serves as a transport system for gases\\n22.2 • The Lungs 959'),\n",

In addition, innervation by the both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems\\nprovides an important level of control through dilation and constriction of the airway.\\nBlood Supply\\nThe major function of the lungs is to perform gas exchange, which requires blood from the pulmonary circulation.\\nThis blood supply contains deoxygenated blood and travels to the lungs where erythrocytes, also known as red\\nblood cells, pick up oxygen to be transported to tissues throughout the body. The pulmonary artery is an artery that\\narises from the pulmonary trunk and carries deoxygenated, arterial blood to the alveoli. The pulmonary artery\\nbranches multiple times as it follows the bronchi, and each branch becomes progressively smaller in diameter. One\\narteriole and an accompanying venule supply and drain one pulmonary lobule. As they near the alveoli, the\\npulmonary arteries become the pulmonary capillary network. The pulmonary capillary network consists of tiny\\nvessels with very thin walls that lack smooth muscle fibers. The capillaries branch and follow the bronchioles and\\nstructure of the alveoli. It is at this point that the capillary wall meets the alveolar wall, creating the respiratory\\nmembrane. Once the blood is oxygenated, it drains from the alveoli by way of multiple pulmonary veins, which exit\\nthe lungs through the hilum.\\nNervous Innervation\\nDilation and constriction of the airway are achieved through nervous control by the parasympathetic and\\nsympathetic nervous systems. The parasympathetic system causes bronchoconstriction, whereas the sympathetic\\nnervous system stimulates bronchodilation. Reflexes such as coughing, and the ability of the lungs to regulate\\noxygen and carbon dioxide levels, also result from this autonomic nervous system control. Sensory nerve fibers arise\\nfrom the vagus nerve, and from the second to fifth thoracic ganglia. The pulmonary plexus is a region on the lung\\nroot formed by the entrance of the nerves at the hilum. The nerves then follow the bronchi in the lungs and branch\\nto innervate muscle fibers, glands, and blood vessels.\\nPleura of the Lungs\\nEach lung is enclosed within a cavity that is surrounded by the pleura. The pleura (plural = pleurae) is a serous\\nmembrane that surrounds the lung. The right and left pleurae, which enclose the right and left lungs, respectively,\\nare separated by the mediastinum. The pleurae consist of two layers. The visceral pleura is the layer that is\\nsuperficial to the lungs, and extends into and lines the lung fissures (Figure 22.14). In contrast, the parietal pleura\\nis the outer layer that connects to the thoracic wall, the mediastinum, and the diaphragm. The visceral and parietal\\npleurae connect to each other at the hilum. The pleural cavity is the space between the visceral and parietal layers.\\nFIGURE 22.14 Parietal and Visceral Pleurae of the Lungs\\n960 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The major mechanisms that drive pulmonary ventilation are atmospheric pressure (Patm); the air pressure\\nwithin the alveoli, called intra-alveolar pressure (Palv); and the pressure within the pleural cavity, called intrapleural\\npressure (Pip).\\nMechanisms of Breathing\\nThe intra-alveolar and intrapleural pressures are dependent on certain physical features of the lung. However, the\\nEveryday Connection\\nThe Effects of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke\\nThe burning of a tobacco cigarette creates multiple chemical compounds that are released through mainstream\\nsmoke, which is inhaled by the smoker, and through sidestream smoke, which is the smoke that is given off by\\nthe burning cigarette. Second-hand smoke, which is a combination of sidestream smoke and the mainstream\\nsmoke that is exhaled by the smoker, has been demonstrated by numerous scientific studies to cause disease.\\nAt least 40 chemicals in sidestream smoke have been identified that negatively impact human health, leading to\\nthe development of cancer or other conditions, such as immune system dysfunction, liver toxicity, cardiac\\narrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and neurological dysfunction. Furthermore, second-hand smoke has been\\nfound to harbor at least 250 compounds that are known to be toxic, carcinogenic, or both. Some major classes\\nof carcinogens in second-hand smoke are polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), N-nitrosamines, aromatic amines,\\nformaldehyde, and acetaldehyde.\\nTobacco and second-hand smoke are considered to be carcinogenic. Exposure to second-hand smoke can cause\\nlung cancer in individuals who are not tobacco users themselves. It is estimated that the risk of developing lung\\ncancer is increased by up to 30 percent in nonsmokers who live with an individual who smokes in the house, as\\ncompared to nonsmokers who are not regularly exposed to second-hand smoke. Children are especially affected\\nby second-hand smoke. Children who live with an individual who smokes inside the home have a larger number\\nof lower respiratory infections, which are associated with hospitalizations, and higher risk of sudden infant death\\nsyndrome (SIDS). Second-hand smoke in the home has also been linked to a greater number of ear infections in\\nchildren, as well as worsening symptoms of asthma.\\n22.3 • The Process of Breathing 961'),\n",

In a gas, pressure is a force created by the movement of gas molecules that are\\nconfined. For example, a certain number of gas molecules in a two-liter container has more room than the same\\nnumber of gas molecules in a one-liter container (Figure 22.15). In this case, the force exerted by the movement of\\nthe gas molecules against the walls of the two-liter container is lower than the force exerted by the gas molecules in\\nthe one-liter container. Therefore, the pressure is lower in the two-liter container and higher in the one-liter\\ncontainer. At a constant temperature, changing the volume occupied by the gas changes the pressure, as does\\nchanging the number of gas molecules. Boyle’s law describes the relationship between volume and pressure in a\\ngas at a constant temperature. Boyle discovered that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume: If\\nvolume increases, pressure decreases. Likewise, if volume decreases, pressure increases. Pressure and volume are\\ninversely related (P = k/V). Therefore, the pressure in the one-liter container (one-half the volume of the two-liter\\ncontainer) would be twice the pressure in the two-liter container. Boyle’s law is expressed by the following formula:\\nIn this formula, P1 represents the initial pressure and V1 represents the initial volume, whereas the final pressure\\nand volume are represented by P2 and V2, respectively. If the two- and one-liter containers were connected by a\\ntube and the volume of one of the containers were changed, then the gases would move from higher pressure (lower\\nvolume) to lower pressure (higher volume).\\nFIGURE 22.15 Boyle's Law In a gas, pressure increases as volume decreases.\\nPulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure: atmospheric, intra-alveolar, and intrapleural.\\nAtmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface, such\\nas the body. Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere, abbreviated atm, or in\\nmillimeters of mercury (mm Hg). One atm is equal to 760 mm Hg, which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level.\\nTypically, for respiration, other pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure.

A pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero.\\nIntra-alveolar pressure (intrapulmonary pressure) is the pressure of the air within the alveoli, which changes\\nduring the different phases of breathing (Figure 22.16). Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the\\ntubing of the airways (similar to the two- and one-liter containers in the example above), the intrapulmonary\\npressure of the alveoli always equalizes with the atmospheric pressure.\\nFIGURE 22.16 Intrapulmonary and Intrapleural Pressure Relationships Intra-alveolar pressure changes during the different phases\\nof the cycle. It equalizes at 760 mm Hg but does not remain at 760 mm Hg.\\nIntrapleural pressure is the pressure of the air within the pleural cavity, between the visceral and parietal pleurae.\\nSimilar to intra-alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure also changes during the different phases of breathing.\\nHowever, due to certain characteristics of the lungs, the intrapleural pressure is always lower than, or negative to,\\nthe intra-alveolar pressure (and therefore also to atmospheric pressure). Although it fluctuates during inspiration\\nand expiration, intrapleural pressure remains approximately –4 mm Hg throughout the breathing cycle.\\nCompeting forces within the thorax cause the formation of the negative intrapleural pressure. One of these forces\\nrelates to the elasticity of the lungs themselves—elastic tissue pulls the lungs inward, away from the thoracic wall.\\nSurface tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly water, also creates an inward pull of the lung tissue. This inward\\ntension from the lungs is countered by opposing forces from the pleural fluid and thoracic wall. Surface tension\\nwithin the pleural cavity pulls the lungs outward. Too much or too little pleural fluid would hinder the creation of the\\nnegative intrapleural pressure; therefore, the level must be closely monitored by the mesothelial cells and drained\\nby the lymphatic system. Since the parietal pleura is attached to the thoracic wall, the natural elasticity of the chest\\nwall opposes the inward pull of the lungs. Ultimately, the outward pull is slightly greater than the inward pull,\\ncreating the –4 mm Hg intrapleural pressure relative to the intra-alveolar pressure. Transpulmonary pressure is the\\ndifference between the intrapleural and intra-alveolar pressures, and it determines the size of the lungs. A higher\\ntranspulmonary pressure corresponds to a larger lung.\\nPhysical Factors Affecting Ventilation\\nIn addition to the differences in pressures, breathing is also dependent upon the contraction and relaxation of\\nmuscle fibers of both the diaphragm and thorax. The lungs themselves are passive during breathing, meaning they\\nare not involved in creating the movement that helps inspiration and expiration. This is because of the adhesive\\nnature of the pleural fluid, which allows the lungs to be pulled outward when the thoracic wall moves during\\ninspiration. The recoil of the thoracic wall during expiration causes compression of the lungs. Contraction and\\n22.3 • The Process of Breathing 963'),\n",

These muscle movements and subsequent pressure changes cause air to\\neither rush in or be forced out of the lungs.\\nOther characteristics of the lungs influence the effort that must be expended to ventilate. Resistance is a force that\\nslows motion, in this case, the flow of gases. The size of the airway is the primary factor affecting resistance. A small\\ntubular diameter forces air through a smaller space, causing more collisions of air molecules with the walls of the\\nairways. The following formula helps to describe the relationship between airway resistance and pressure changes:\\nAs noted earlier, there is surface tension within the alveoli caused by water present in the lining of the alveoli. This\\nsurface tension tends to inhibit expansion of the alveoli. However, pulmonary surfactant secreted by type II alveolar\\ncells mixes with that water and helps reduce this surface tension. Without pulmonary surfactant, the alveoli would\\ncollapse during expiration.\\nThoracic wall compliance is the ability of the thoracic wall to stretch while under pressure. This can also affect the\\neffort expended in the process of breathing. In order for inspiration to occur, the thoracic cavity must expand. The\\nexpansion of the thoracic cavity directly influences the capacity of the lungs to expand. If the tissues of the thoracic\\nwall are not very compliant, it will be difficult to expand the thorax to increase the size of the lungs.\\nPulmonary Ventilation\\nThe difference in pressures drives pulmonary ventilation because air flows down a pressure gradient, that is, air\\nflows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air flows into the lungs largely due to a difference\\nin pressure; atmospheric pressure is greater than intra-alveolar pressure, and intra-alveolar pressure is greater than\\nintrapleural pressure. Air flows out of the lungs during expiration based on the same principle; pressure within the\\nlungs becomes greater than the atmospheric pressure.\\nPulmonary ventilation comprises two major steps: inspiration and expiration. Inspiration is the process that causes\\nair to enter the lungs, and expiration is the process that causes air to leave the lungs (Figure 22.17). A respiratory\\ncycle is one sequence of inspiration and expiration. In general, two muscle groups are used during normal\\ninspiration: the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. Additional muscles can be used if a bigger breath is\\nrequired. When the diaphragm contracts, it moves inferiorly toward the abdominal cavity, creating a larger thoracic\\ncavity and more space for the lungs. Contraction of the external intercostal muscles moves the ribs upward and\\noutward, causing the rib cage to expand, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity. Due to the adhesive\\nforce of the pleural fluid, the expansion of the thoracic cavity forces the lungs to stretch and expand as well. This\\nincrease in volume leads to a decrease in intra-alveolar pressure, creating a pressure lower than atmospheric\\npressure. As a result, a pressure gradient is created that drives air into the lungs.\\n964 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

In turn, the thoracic cavity and lungs decrease in volume, causing an increase in\\nintrapulmonary pressure. The intrapulmonary pressure rises above atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure\\ngradient that causes air to leave the lungs.\\nThere are different types, or modes, of breathing that require a slightly different process to allow inspiration and\\nexpiration. Quiet breathing, also known as eupnea, is a mode of breathing that occurs at rest and does not require\\nthe cognitive thought of the individual. During quiet breathing, the diaphragm and external intercostals must\\ncontract.\\nA deep breath, called diaphragmatic breathing, requires the diaphragm to contract. As the diaphragm relaxes, air\\npassively leaves the lungs. A shallow breath, called costal breathing, requires contraction of the intercostal muscles.\\nAs the intercostal muscles relax, air passively leaves the lungs.\\nIn contrast, forced breathing, also known as hyperpnea, is a mode of breathing that can occur during exercise or\\nactions that require the active manipulation of breathing, such as singing. During forced breathing, inspiration and\\nexpiration both occur due to muscle contractions. In addition to the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal\\nmuscles, other accessory muscles must also contract. During forced inspiration, muscles of the neck, including the\\nscalenes, contract and lift the thoracic wall, increasing lung volume. During forced expiration, accessory muscles of\\nthe abdomen, including the obliques, contract, forcing abdominal organs upward against the diaphragm. This helps\\nto push the diaphragm further into the thorax, pushing more air out. In addition, accessory muscles (primarily the\\ninternal intercostals) help to compress the rib cage, which also reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity.\\nRespiratory Volumes and Capacities\\nRespiratory volume is the term used for various volumes of air moved by or associated with the lungs at a given\\npoint in the respiratory cycle. There are four major types of respiratory volumes: tidal, residual, inspiratory reserve,\\nand expiratory reserve (Figure 22.18). Tidal volume (TV) is the amount of air that normally enters the lungs during\\nquiet breathing, which is about 500 milliliters. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is the amount of air you can\\nforcefully exhale past a normal tidal expiration, up to 1200 milliliters for males. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is\\nproduced by a deep inhalation, past a tidal inspiration. This is the extra volume that can be brought into the lungs\\nduring a forced inspiration.

Total dead space is the anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space\\ntogether, and represents all of the air in the respiratory system that is not being used in the gas exchange process.\\nRespiratory Rate and Control of Ventilation\\nBreathing usually occurs without thought, although at times you can consciously control it, such as when you swim\\nunder water, sing a song, or blow bubbles. The respiratory rate is the total number of breaths, or respiratory cycles,\\nthat occur each minute. Respiratory rate can be an important indicator of disease, as the rate may increase or\\ndecrease during an illness or in a disease condition. The respiratory rate is controlled by the respiratory center\\nlocated within the medulla oblongata in the brain, which responds primarily to changes in carbon dioxide, oxygen,\\nand pH levels in the blood.\\nThe normal respiratory rate of a child decreases from birth to adolescence. A child under 1 year of age has a normal\\nrespiratory rate between 30 and 60 breaths per minute, but by the time a child is about 10 years old, the normal\\nrate is closer to 18 to 30.

It is a dose-response, negative-feedback relationship in\\nwhich the greater the stimulus, the greater the response. Thus, increasing stimuli results in forced breathing.\\nMultiple systemic factors are involved in stimulating the brain to produce pulmonary ventilation.\\nThe major factor that stimulates the medulla oblongata and pons to produce respiration is surprisingly not oxygen\\nconcentration, but rather the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. As you recall, carbon dioxide is a waste\\nproduct of cellular respiration and can be toxic. Concentrations of chemicals are sensed by chemoreceptors. A\\ncentral chemoreceptor is one of the specialized receptors that are located in the brain and brainstem, whereas a\\nperipheral chemoreceptor is one of the specialized receptors located in the carotid arteries and aortic arch.\\nConcentration changes in certain substances, such as carbon dioxide or hydrogen ions, stimulate these receptors,\\nwhich in turn signal the respiration centers of the brain. In the case of carbon dioxide, as the concentration of CO2 in\\nthe blood increases, it readily diffuses across the blood-brain barrier, where it collects in the extracellular fluid. As\\nwill be explained in more detail later, increased carbon dioxide levels lead to increased levels of hydrogen ions,\\ndecreasing pH. The increase in hydrogen ions in the brain triggers the central chemoreceptors to stimulate the\\nrespiratory centers to initiate contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. As a result, the rate and depth\\nof respiration increase, allowing more carbon dioxide to be expelled, which brings more air into and out of the lungs\\npromoting a reduction in the blood levels of carbon dioxide, and therefore hydrogen ions, in the blood. In contrast,\\nlow levels of carbon dioxide in the blood cause low levels of hydrogen ions in the brain, leading to a decrease in the\\nrate and depth of pulmonary ventilation, producing shallow, slow breathing.\\nAnother factor involved in influencing the respiratory activity of the brain is systemic arterial concentrations of\\nhydrogen ions. Increasing carbon dioxide levels can lead to increased H+ levels, as mentioned above, as well as\\nother metabolic activities, such as lactic acid accumulation after strenuous exercise. Peripheral chemoreceptors of\\nthe aortic arch and carotid arteries sense arterial levels of hydrogen ions. When peripheral chemoreceptors sense\\ndecreasing, or more acidic, pH levels, they stimulate an increase in ventilation to remove carbon dioxide from the\\nblood at a quicker rate. Removal of carbon dioxide from the blood helps to reduce hydrogen ions, thus increasing\\nsystemic pH.\\nBlood levels of oxygen are also important in influencing respiratory rate. The peripheral chemoreceptors are\\nresponsible for sensing large changes in blood oxygen levels. If blood oxygen levels become quite low—about 60\\nmm Hg or less—then peripheral chemoreceptors stimulate an increase in respiratory activity. The chemoreceptors\\nare only able to sense dissolved oxygen molecules, not the oxygen that is bound to hemoglobin. As you recall, the\\nmajority of oxygen is bound by hemoglobin; when dissolved levels of oxygen drop, hemoglobin releases oxygen.\\nTherefore, a large drop in oxygen levels is required to stimulate the chemoreceptors of the aortic arch and carotid\\narteries.\\nThe hypothalamus and other brain regions associated with the limbic system also play roles in influencing the\\nregulation of breathing by interacting with the respiratory centers. The hypothalamus and other regions associated\\nwith the limbic system are involved in regulating respiration in response to emotions, pain, and temperature. For\\nexample, an increase in body temperature causes an increase in respiratory rate. Feeling excited or the fight-or-\\nflight response will also result in an increase in respiratory rate.\\nDisorders of the...\\nRespiratory System: Sleep Apnea\\nSleep apnea is a chronic disorder that can occur in children or adults, and is characterized by the cessation of\\nbreathing during sleep.

It is through this\\nmechanism that blood is oxygenated and carbon dioxide, the waste product of cellular respiration, is removed from\\nthe body.\\nGas Exchange\\nIn order to understand the mechanisms of gas exchange in the lung, it is important to understand the underlying\\nprinciples of gases and their behavior. In addition to Boyle’s law, several other gas laws help to describe the\\nbehavior of gases.\\nGas Laws and Air Composition\\nGas molecules exert force on the surfaces with which they are in contact; this force is called pressure. In natural\\nsystems, gases are normally present as a mixture of different types of molecules. For example, the atmosphere\\nconsists of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules, and this gaseous mixture exerts a\\ncertain pressure referred to as atmospheric pressure (Table 22.2). Partial pressure (Px) is the pressure of a single\\ntype of gas in a mixture of gases. For example, in the atmosphere, oxygen exerts a partial pressure, and nitrogen\\nexerts another partial pressure, independent of the partial pressure of oxygen (Figure 22.21). Total pressure is the\\nsum of all the partial pressures of a gaseous mixture. Dalton’s law describes the behavior of nonreactive gases in a\\ncaused by an obstruction of the airway during sleep, which can occur at different points in the airway, depending\\non the underlying cause of the obstruction. For example, the tongue and throat muscles of some individuals with\\nobstructive sleep apnea may relax excessively, causing the muscles to push into the airway. Another example is\\nobesity, which is a known risk factor for sleep apnea, as excess adipose tissue in the neck region can push the\\nsoft tissues towards the lumen of the airway, causing the trachea to narrow.\\nIn central sleep apnea, the respiratory centers of the brain do not respond properly to rising carbon dioxide\\nlevels and therefore do not stimulate the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles regularly. As a\\nresult, inspiration does not occur and breathing stops for a short period. In some cases, the cause of central\\nsleep apnea is unknown. However, some medical conditions, such as stroke and congestive heart failure, may\\ncause damage to the pons or medulla oblongata. In addition, some pharmacologic agents, such as morphine,\\ncan affect the respiratory centers, causing a decrease in the respiratory rate. The symptoms of central sleep\\napnea are similar to those of obstructive sleep apnea.\\nA diagnosis of sleep apnea is usually done during a sleep study, where the patient is monitored in a sleep\\nlaboratory for several nights. The patient’s blood oxygen levels, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure\\nare monitored, as are brain activity and the volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled. Treatment of sleep apnea\\ncommonly includes the use of a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine during\\nsleep. The CPAP machine has a mask that covers the nose, or the nose and mouth, and forces air into the airway\\nat regular intervals. This pressurized air can help to gently force the airway to remain open, allowing more\\nnormal ventilation to occur. Other treatments include lifestyle changes to decrease weight, eliminate alcohol\\nand other sleep apnea–promoting drugs, and changes in sleep position. In addition to these treatments,\\npatients with central sleep apnea may need supplemental oxygen during sleep.\\n970 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Recall that gases tend to equalize their\\npressure in two regions that are connected. A gas will move from an area where its partial pressure is higher to an\\narea where its partial pressure is lower. In addition, the greater the partial pressure difference between the two\\nareas, the more rapid is the movement of gases.\\nSolubility of Gases in Liquids\\nHenry’s law describes the behavior of gases when they come into contact with a liquid, such as blood. Henry’s law\\nstates that the concentration of gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the solubility and partial pressure of that\\ngas. The greater the partial pressure of the gas, the greater the number of gas molecules that will dissolve in the\\nliquid. The concentration of the gas in a liquid is also dependent on the solubility of the gas in the liquid. For\\nexample, although nitrogen is present in the atmosphere, very little nitrogen dissolves into the blood, because the\\nsolubility of nitrogen in blood is very low. The exception to this occurs in scuba divers; the composition of the\\ncompressed air that divers breathe causes nitrogen to have a higher partial pressure than normal, causing it to\\ndissolve in the blood in greater amounts than normal. Too much nitrogen in the bloodstream results in a serious\\ncondition that can be fatal if not corrected. Gas molecules establish an equilibrium between those molecules\\ndissolved in liquid and those in air.\\nThe composition of air in the atmosphere and in the alveoli differs. In both cases, the relative concentration of gases\\nis nitrogen > oxygen > water vapor > carbon dioxide. The amount of water vapor present in alveolar air is greater\\nthan that in atmospheric air (Table 22.3). Recall that the respiratory system works to humidify incoming air, thereby\\ncausing the air present in the alveoli to have a greater amount of water vapor than atmospheric air. In addition,\\nalveolar air contains a greater amount of carbon dioxide and less oxygen than atmospheric air. This is no surprise, as\\n22.4 • Gas Exchange 971'),\n",

Ventilation is the movement of air\\ninto and out of the lungs, and perfusion is the flow of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. For gas exchange to be\\nefficient, the volumes involved in ventilation and perfusion should be compatible. However, factors such as regional\\ngravity effects on blood, blocked alveolar ducts, or disease can cause ventilation and perfusion to be imbalanced.\\nThe partial pressure of oxygen in alveolar air is about 104 mm Hg, whereas the partial pressure of oxygenated blood\\nin pulmonary veins is about 100 mm Hg. When ventilation is sufficient, oxygen enters the alveoli at a high rate, and\\nthe partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli remains high. In contrast, when ventilation is insufficient, the partial\\npressure of oxygen in the alveoli drops. Without the large difference in partial pressure between the alveoli and the\\nblood, oxygen does not diffuse efficiently across the respiratory membrane. The body has mechanisms that\\ncounteract this problem. In cases when ventilation is not sufficient for an alveolus, the body redirects blood flow to\\nalveoli that are receiving sufficient ventilation. This is achieved by constricting the pulmonary arterioles that serves\\nthe dysfunctional alveolus, which redirects blood to other alveoli that have sufficient ventilation. At the same time,\\nthe pulmonary arterioles that serve alveoli receiving sufficient ventilation vasodilate, which brings in greater blood\\nflow. Factors such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and pH levels can all serve as stimuli for adjusting blood flow in the\\ncapillary networks associated with the alveoli.\\nVentilation is regulated by the diameter of the airways, whereas perfusion is regulated by the diameter of the blood\\nvessels. The diameter of the bronchioles is sensitive to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli. A greater\\npartial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveoli causes the bronchioles to increase their diameter as will a\\ndecreased level of oxygen in the blood supply, allowing carbon dioxide to be exhaled from the body at a greater rate.\\nAs mentioned above, a greater partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli causes the pulmonary arterioles to dilate,\\nincreasing blood flow.\\nGas Exchange\\nGas exchange occurs at two sites in the body: in the lungs, where oxygen is picked up and carbon dioxide is released\\nat the respiratory membrane, and at the tissues, where oxygen is released and carbon dioxide is picked up. External\\nrespiration is the exchange of gases with the external environment, and occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Internal\\nrespiration is the exchange of gases with the internal environment, and occurs in the tissues. The actual exchange of\\ngases occurs due to simple diffusion. Energy is not required to move oxygen or carbon dioxide across membranes.\\nInstead, these gases follow pressure gradients that allow them to diffuse.

These pulmonary capillaries create the\\nrespiratory membrane with the alveoli (Figure 22.22). As the blood is pumped through this capillary network, gas\\nexchange occurs. Although a small amount of the oxygen is able to dissolve directly into plasma from the alveoli,\\nmost of the oxygen is picked up by erythrocytes (red blood cells) and binds to a protein called hemoglobin, a process\\ndescribed later in this chapter. Oxygenated hemoglobin is red, causing the overall appearance of bright red\\noxygenated blood, which returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins. Carbon dioxide is released in the\\nopposite direction of oxygen, from the blood to the alveoli. Some of the carbon dioxide is returned on hemoglobin,\\nbut can also be dissolved in plasma or is present as a converted form, also explained in greater detail later in this\\nchapter.\\nExternal respiration occurs as a function of partial pressure differences in oxygen and carbon dioxide between the\\nalveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries.\\nFIGURE 22.22 External Respiration In external respiration, oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the alveolus to the\\ncapillary, whereas carbon dioxide diffuses out of the capillary into the alveolus.\\nAlthough the solubility of oxygen in blood is not high, there is a drastic difference in the partial pressure of oxygen in\\nthe alveoli versus in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries. This difference is about 64 mm Hg: The partial pressure\\nof oxygen in the alveoli is about 104 mm Hg, whereas its partial pressure in the blood of the capillary is about 40\\nmm Hg. This large difference in partial pressure creates a very strong pressure gradient that causes oxygen to\\nrapidly cross the respiratory membrane from the alveoli into the blood.\\nThe partial pressure of carbon dioxide is also different between the alveolar air and the blood of the capillary.\\nHowever, the partial pressure difference is less than that of oxygen, about 5 mm Hg. The partial pressure of carbon\\ndioxide in the blood of the capillary is about 45 mm Hg, whereas its partial pressure in the alveoli is about 40 mm\\nHg. However, the solubility of carbon dioxide is much greater than that of oxygen—by a factor of about 20—in both\\nblood and alveolar fluids. As a result, the relative concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide that diffuse across\\nthe respiratory membrane are similar.\\nInternal Respiration\\nInternal respiration is gas exchange that occurs at the level of body tissues (Figure 22.23). Similar to external\\nrespiration, internal respiration also occurs as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient. However, the\\npartial pressure gradients are opposite of those present at the respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen\\nin tissues is low, about 40 mm Hg, because oxygen is continuously used for cellular respiration. In contrast, the\\npartial pressure of oxygen in the blood is about 100 mm Hg. This creates a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to\\ndissociate from hemoglobin, diffuse out of the blood, cross the interstitial space, and enter the tissue.

A hyperbaric chamber is a unit that can be sealed and expose a patient to either 100 percent oxygen\\nwith increased pressure or a mixture of gases that includes a higher concentration of oxygen than normal\\natmospheric air, also at a higher partial pressure than the atmosphere. There are two major types of chambers:\\nmonoplace and multiplace. Monoplace chambers are typically for one patient, and the staff tending to the\\npatient observes the patient from outside of the chamber (Figure 22.24). Some facilities have special monoplace\\nhyperbaric chambers that allow multiple patients to be treated at once, usually in a sitting or reclining position,\\nto help ease feelings of isolation or claustrophobia. Multiplace chambers are large enough for multiple patients\\nto be treated at one time, and the staff attending these patients is present inside the chamber. In a multiplace\\nchamber, patients are often treated with air via a mask or hood, and the chamber is pressurized.\\n974 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

Exposure to and poisoning by carbon monoxide\\nis difficult to reverse, because hemoglobin’s affinity for carbon monoxide is much stronger than its affinity for\\noxygen, causing carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in the blood. Hyperbaric chamber therapy can treat carbon\\nmonoxide poisoning, because the increased atmospheric pressure causes more oxygen to diffuse into the\\nbloodstream. At this increased pressure and increased concentration of oxygen, carbon monoxide is displaced\\nfrom hemoglobin. Another example is the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections, which are created by\\nbacteria that cannot or prefer not to live in the presence of oxygen. An increase in blood and tissue levels of\\noxygen helps to kill the anaerobic bacteria that are responsible for the infection, as oxygen is toxic to anaerobic\\nbacteria.

The majority of oxygen molecules are carried from the lungs to the body’s tissues by a specialized\\ntransport system, which relies on the erythrocyte—the red blood cell. Erythrocytes contain a metalloprotein,\\nhemoglobin, which serves to bind oxygen molecules to the erythrocyte (Figure 22.25). Heme is the portion of\\nhemoglobin that contains iron, and it is heme that binds oxygen. Each hemoglobin molecule contains four iron-\\ncontaining heme molecules, and because of this, one hemoglobin molecule is capable of carrying up to four\\nmolecules of oxygen. As oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane from the alveolus to the capillary, it also\\ndiffuses into the red blood cell and is bound by hemoglobin. The following reversible chemical reaction describes\\nthe production of the final product, oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), which is formed when oxygen binds to hemoglobin.\\nOxyhemoglobin is a bright red-colored molecule that contributes to the bright red color of oxygenated blood.\\nIn this formula, Hb represents reduced hemoglobin, that is, hemoglobin that does not have oxygen bound to it.\\nThere are multiple factors involved in how readily heme binds to and dissociates from oxygen, which will be\\ndiscussed in the subsequent sections.\\nFIGURE 22.25 Erythrocyte and Hemoglobin Hemoglobin consists of four subunits, each of which contains one molecule of iron.\\nFunction of Hemoglobin\\nHemoglobin is composed of subunits, a protein structure that is referred to as a quaternary structure. Each of the\\nfour subunits that make up hemoglobin is arranged in a ring-like fashion, with an iron atom covalently bound to the\\nheme in the center of each subunit. Binding of the first oxygen molecule causes a conformational change in\\nhemoglobin that allows the second molecule of oxygen to bind more readily. As each molecule of oxygen is bound, it\\nfurther facilitates the binding of the next molecule, until all four heme sites are occupied by oxygen. The opposite\\noccurs as well: After the first oxygen molecule dissociates and is “dropped off” at the tissues, the next oxygen\\nmolecule dissociates more readily. When all four heme sites are occupied, the hemoglobin is said to be saturated.\\nWhen one to three heme sites are occupied, the hemoglobin is said to be partially saturated. Therefore, when\\nconsidering the blood as a whole, the percent of the available heme units that are bound to oxygen at a given time is\\ncalled hemoglobin saturation. Hemoglobin saturation of 100 percent means that every heme unit in all of the\\nerythrocytes of the body is bound to oxygen. In a healthy individual with normal hemoglobin levels, hemoglobin\\nsaturation generally ranges from 95 percent to 99 percent.\\nOxygen Dissociation from Hemoglobin\\nPartial pressure is an important aspect of the binding of oxygen to and disassociation from heme. An\\noxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve is a graph that describes the relationship of partial pressure to the binding\\nof oxygen to heme and its subsequent dissociation from heme (Figure 22.26).

This is important\\nbecause some tissues have a higher metabolic rate than others. Highly active tissues, such as muscle, rapidly use\\noxygen to produce ATP, lowering the partial pressure of oxygen in the tissue to about 20 mm Hg. The partial\\npressure of oxygen inside capillaries is about 100 mm Hg, so the difference between the two becomes quite high,\\nabout 80 mm Hg. As a result, a greater number of oxygen molecules dissociate from hemoglobin and enter the\\ntissues. The reverse is true of tissues, such as adipose (body fat), which have lower metabolic rates. Because less\\noxygen is used by these cells, the partial pressure of oxygen within such tissues remains relatively high, resulting in\\nfewer oxygen molecules dissociating from hemoglobin and entering the tissue interstitial fluid. Although venous\\nblood is said to be deoxygenated, some oxygen is still bound to hemoglobin in its red blood cells. This provides an\\noxygen reserve that can be used when tissues suddenly demand more oxygen.\\nFactors other than partial pressure also affect the oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve. For example, a\\nhigher temperature promotes hemoglobin and oxygen to dissociate faster, whereas a lower temperature inhibits\\ndissociation (see Figure 22.26, middle). However, the human body tightly regulates temperature, so this factor may\\nnot affect gas exchange throughout the body. The exception to this is in highly active tissues, which may release a\\nlarger amount of energy than is given off as heat. As a result, oxygen readily dissociates from hemoglobin, which is a\\nmechanism that helps to provide active tissues with more oxygen.\\nCertain hormones, such as androgens, epinephrine, thyroid hormones, and growth hormone, can affect the\\noxygen–hemoglobin saturation/disassociation curve by stimulating the production of a compound called\\n2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) by erythrocytes. BPG is a byproduct of glycolysis. Because erythrocytes do not\\ncontain mitochondria, glycolysis is the sole method by which these cells produce ATP. BPG promotes the\\ndisassociation of oxygen from hemoglobin. Therefore, the greater the concentration of BPG, the more readily oxygen\\ndissociates from hemoglobin, despite its partial pressure.\\nThe pH of the blood is another factor that influences the oxygen–hemoglobin saturation/dissociation curve (see\\nFigure 22.26). The Bohr effect is a phenomenon that arises from the relationship between pH and oxygen’s affinity\\nfor hemoglobin: A lower, more acidic pH promotes oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin. In contrast, a higher, or\\nmore basic, pH inhibits oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin. The greater the amount of carbon dioxide in the\\nblood, the more molecules that must be converted, which in turn generates hydrogen ions and thus lowers blood\\npH. Furthermore, blood pH may become more acidic when certain byproducts of cell metabolism, such as lactic\\nacid, carbonic acid, and carbon dioxide, are released into the bloodstream.\\nHemoglobin of the Fetus\\nThe fetus has its own circulation with its own erythrocytes; however, it is dependent on the pregnant person for\\n978 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",

The mechanism of gas exchange at the chorion is similar to gas\\nexchange at the respiratory membrane.

The difference in partial pressures between\\nmaternal and fetal blood is not large, as the partial pressure of oxygen in fetal blood at the placenta is about 20 mm\\nHg. Therefore, there is not as much diffusion of oxygen into the fetal blood supply. The fetus’ hemoglobin overcomes\\nthis problem by having a greater affinity for oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (Figure 22.27). Both fetal and adult\\nhemoglobin have four subunits, but two of the subunits of fetal hemoglobin have a different structure that causes\\nfetal hemoglobin to have a greater affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin.\\nFIGURE 22.27 Oxygen-Hemoglobin Dissociation Curves in Fetus and Adult Fetal hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen than\\ndoes adult hemoglobin.\\nCarbon Dioxide Transport in the Blood\\nCarbon dioxide is transported by three major mechanisms.

The dissolved carbon dioxide\\nthen travels in the bloodstream and when the blood reaches the pulmonary capillaries, the dissolved carbon dioxide\\ndiffuses across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli, where it is then exhaled during pulmonary ventilation.\\nBicarbonate Buffer\\nA large fraction—about 70 percent—of the carbon dioxide molecules that diffuse into the blood is transported to the\\nlungs as bicarbonate. Most bicarbonate is produced in erythrocytes after carbon dioxide diffuses into the capillaries,\\nand subsequently into red blood cells. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) causes carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic\\nacid (H2CO3), which dissociates into two ions: bicarbonate (HCO3–) and hydrogen (H+). The following formula\\ndepicts this reaction:\\nBicarbonate tends to build up in the erythrocytes, so that there is a greater concentration of bicarbonate in the\\nerythrocytes than in the surrounding blood plasma. As a result, some of the bicarbonate will leave the erythrocytes\\nand move down its concentration gradient into the plasma in exchange for chloride (Cl–) ions. This phenomenon is\\nreferred to as the chloride shift and occurs because by exchanging one negative ion for another negative ion,\\nneither the electrical charge of the erythrocytes nor that of the blood is altered.\\nAt the pulmonary capillaries, the chemical reaction that produced bicarbonate (shown above) is reversed, and\\ncarbon dioxide and water are the products. Much of the bicarbonate in the plasma re-enters the erythrocytes in\\nexchange for chloride ions. Hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions join to form carbonic acid, which is converted into\\ncarbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase. Carbon dioxide diffuses out of the erythrocytes and into the\\nplasma, where it can further diffuse across the respiratory membrane into the alveoli to be exhaled during\\npulmonary ventilation.\\nCarbaminohemoglobin\\nAbout 20 percent of carbon dioxide is bound by hemoglobin and is transported to the lungs. Carbon dioxide does not\\nbind to iron as oxygen does; instead, carbon dioxide binds amino acid moieties on the globin portions of hemoglobin\\nto form carbaminohemoglobin, which forms when hemoglobin and carbon dioxide bind. When hemoglobin is not\\ntransporting oxygen, it tends to have a bluish-purple tone to it, creating the darker maroon color typical of\\ndeoxygenated blood. The following formula depicts this reversible reaction:\\nSimilar to the transport of oxygen by heme, the binding and dissociation of carbon dioxide to and from hemoglobin is\\ndependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Because carbon dioxide is released from the lungs, blood that\\nleaves the lungs and reaches body tissues has a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide than is found in the tissues.\\nAs a result, carbon dioxide leaves the tissues because of its higher partial pressure, enters the blood, and then\\nmoves into red blood cells, binding to hemoglobin. In contrast, in the pulmonary capillaries, the partial pressure of\\ncarbon dioxide is high compared to within the alveoli. As a result, carbon dioxide dissociates readily from\\nhemoglobin and diffuses across the respiratory membrane into the air.\\nIn addition to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and the partial pressure of\\noxygen in the blood also influence the affinity of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide. The Haldane effect is a\\nphenomenon that arises from the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen and the affinity of hemoglobin\\nfor carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen does not readily bind carbon dioxide.

Muscles that perform work during exercise do\\nincrease their demand for oxygen, stimulating an increase in ventilation. However, hyperpnea during exercise\\nappears to occur before a drop in oxygen levels within the muscles can occur. Therefore, hyperpnea must be driven\\nby other mechanisms, either instead of or in addition to a drop in oxygen levels. The exact mechanisms behind\\nexercise hyperpnea are not well understood, and some hypotheses are somewhat controversial. However, in\\naddition to low oxygen, high carbon dioxide, and low pH levels, there appears to be a complex interplay of factors\\nrelated to the nervous system and the respiratory centers of the brain.\\nFirst, a conscious decision to partake in exercise, or another form of physical exertion, results in a psychological\\nstimulus that may trigger the respiratory centers of the brain to increase ventilation. In addition, the respiratory\\ncenters of the brain may be stimulated through the activation of motor neurons that innervate muscle groups that\\nare involved in the physical activity. Finally, physical exertion stimulates proprioceptors, which are receptors located\\nwithin the muscles, joints, and tendons, which sense movement and stretching; proprioceptors thus create a\\nstimulus that may also trigger the respiratory centers of the brain. These neural factors are consistent with the\\nsudden increase in ventilation that is observed immediately as exercise begins. Because the respiratory centers are\\nstimulated by psychological, motor neuron, and proprioceptor inputs throughout exercise, the fact that there is also\\na sudden decrease in ventilation immediately after the exercise ends when these neural stimuli cease, further\\nsupports the idea that they are involved in triggering the changes of ventilation.\\nHigh Altitude Effects\\nAn increase in altitude results in a decrease in atmospheric pressure. Although the proportion of oxygen relative to\\ngases in the atmosphere remains at 21 percent, its partial pressure decreases (Table 22.4). As a result, it is more\\ndifficult for a body to achieve the same level of oxygen saturation at high altitude than at low altitude, due to lower\\natmospheric pressure. In fact, hemoglobin saturation is lower at high altitudes compared to hemoglobin saturation\\nat sea level. For example, hemoglobin saturation is about 67 percent at 19,000 feet above sea level, whereas it\\nreaches about 98 percent at sea level.\\n22.6 • Modifications in Respiratory Functions 981'),\n",

Everest, Tibet 29,000 260 54\\nTABLE 22.4\\nAs you recall, partial pressure is extremely important in determining how much gas can cross the respiratory\\nmembrane and enter the blood of the pulmonary capillaries. A lower partial pressure of oxygen means that there is a\\nsmaller difference in partial pressures between the alveoli and the blood, so less oxygen crosses the respiratory\\nmembrane. As a result, fewer oxygen molecules are bound by hemoglobin. Despite this, the tissues of the body still\\nreceive a sufficient amount of oxygen during rest at high altitudes. This is due to two major mechanisms. First, the\\nnumber of oxygen molecules that enter the tissue from the blood is nearly equal between sea level and high\\naltitudes. At sea level, hemoglobin saturation is higher, but only a quarter of the oxygen molecules are actually\\nreleased into the tissue. At high altitudes, a greater proportion of molecules of oxygen are released into the tissues.\\nSecondly, at high altitudes, a greater amount of BPG is produced by erythrocytes, which enhances the dissociation\\nof oxygen from hemoglobin. Physical exertion, such as skiing or hiking, can lead to altitude sickness due to the low\\namount of oxygen reserves in the blood at high altitudes. At sea level, there is a large amount of oxygen reserve in\\nvenous blood (even though venous blood is thought of as “deoxygenated”) from which the muscles can draw during\\nphysical exertion. Because the oxygen saturation is much lower at higher altitudes, this venous reserve is small,\\nresulting in pathological symptoms of low blood oxygen levels. You may have heard that it is important to drink more\\nwater when traveling at higher altitudes than you are accustomed to. This is because your body will increase\\nmicturition (urination) at high altitudes to counteract the effects of lower oxygen levels. By removing fluids, blood\\nplasma levels drop but not the total number of erythrocytes. In this way, the overall concentration of erythrocytes in\\nthe blood increases, which helps tissues obtain the oxygen they need.\\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS), or altitude sickness, is a condition that results from acute exposure to high\\naltitudes due to a low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes. AMS typically can occur at 2400 meters (8000\\nfeet) above sea level. AMS is a result of low blood oxygen levels, as the body has acute difficulty adjusting to the low\\npartial pressure of oxygen. In serious cases, AMS can cause pulmonary or cerebral edema. Symptoms of AMS\\ninclude nausea, vomiting, fatigue, lightheadedness, drowsiness, feeling disoriented, increased pulse, and\\nnosebleeds. The only treatment for AMS is descending to a lower altitude; however, pharmacologic treatments and\\nsupplemental oxygen can improve symptoms. AMS can be prevented by slowly ascending to the desired altitude,\\nallowing the body to acclimate, as well as maintaining proper hydration.\\nAcclimatization\\nEspecially in situations where the ascent occurs too quickly, traveling to areas of high altitude can cause AMS.\\nAcclimatization is the process of adjustment that the respiratory system makes due to chronic exposure to a high\\naltitude. Over a period of time, the body adjusts to accommodate the lower partial pressure of oxygen. The low\\npartial pressure of oxygen at high altitudes results in a lower oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin in the blood.

As a result, the kidneys are stimulated to produce the hormone\\nerythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the production of erythrocytes, resulting in a greater number of circulating\\nerythrocytes in an individual at a high altitude over a long period. With more red blood cells, there is more\\nhemoglobin to help transport the available oxygen. Even though there is low saturation of each hemoglobin\\nmolecule, there will be more hemoglobin present, and therefore more oxygen in the blood. Over time, this allows the\\nperson to partake in physical exertion without developing AMS.\\n22.7 Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Create a timeline of the phases of respiratory development in the fetus\\n• Propose reasons for fetal breathing movements\\n• Explain how the lungs become inflated after birth\\nDevelopment of the respiratory system begins early in the fetus. It is a complex process that includes many\\nstructures, most of which arise from the endoderm. Towards the end of development, the fetus can be observed\\nmaking breathing movements. Until birth, however, the pregnant person provides all of the oxygen to the fetus as\\nwell as removes all of the fetal carbon dioxide via the placenta.\\nTime Line\\nThe development of the respiratory system begins at about week 4 of gestation. By week 28, enough alveoli have\\nmatured that a baby born prematurely at this time can usually breathe on its own. The respiratory system, however,\\nis not fully developed until early childhood, when a full complement of mature alveoli is present.\\nWeeks 4–7\\nRespiratory development in the embryo begins around week 4. Ectodermal tissue from the anterior head region\\ninvaginates posteriorly to form olfactory pits, which fuse with endodermal tissue of the developing pharynx. An\\nolfactory pit is one of a pair of structures that will enlarge to become the nasal cavity. At about this same time, the\\nlung bud forms. The lung bud is a dome-shaped structure composed of tissue that bulges from the foregut. The\\nforegut is endoderm just inferior to the pharyngeal pouches. The laryngotracheal bud is a structure that forms from\\nthe longitudinal extension of the lung bud as development progresses. The portion of this structure nearest the\\npharynx becomes the trachea, whereas the distal end becomes more bulbous, forming bronchial buds. A bronchial\\nbud is one of a pair of structures that will eventually become the bronchi and all other lower respiratory structures\\n(Figure 22.29).\\n22.7 • Embryonic Development of the Respiratory System 983'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\Anatomy and Physiology, OpenStax, Rice University.pdf', 'page': 999}, page_content='FIGURE 22.29 Development of the Lower Respiratory System\\nWeeks 7–16\\nBronchial buds continue to branch as development progresses until all of the segmental bronchi have been formed.\\nBeginning around week 13, the lumens of the bronchi begin to expand in diameter. By week 16, respiratory\\nbronchioles form. The fetus now has all major lung structures involved in the airway.\\nWeeks 16–24\\nOnce the respiratory bronchioles form, further development includes extensive vascularization, or the development\\nof the blood vessels, as well as the formation of alveolar ducts and alveolar precursors. At about week 19, the\\nrespiratory bronchioles have formed. In addition, cells lining the respiratory structures begin to differentiate to form\\ntype I and type II pneumocytes. Once type II cells have differentiated, they begin to secrete small amounts of\\npulmonary surfactant. Around week 20, fetal breathing movements may begin.\\nWeeks 24–Term\\nMajor growth and maturation of the respiratory system occurs from week 24 until term. More alveolar precursors\\ndevelop, and larger amounts of pulmonary surfactant are produced. Surfactant levels are not generally adequate to\\ncreate effective lung compliance until about the eighth month of pregnancy. The respiratory system continues to\\nexpand, and the surfaces that will form the respiratory membrane develop further. At this point, pulmonary\\ncapillaries have formed and continue to expand, creating a large surface area for gas exchange. The major milestone\\nof respiratory development occurs at around week 28, when sufficient alveolar precursors have matured so that a\\nbaby born prematurely at this time can usually breathe on its own. However, alveoli continue to develop and mature\\ninto childhood. A full complement of functional alveoli does not appear until around 8 years of age.\\nFetal “Breathing”\\nAlthough the function of fetal breathing movements is not entirely clear, they can be observed starting at 20–21\\nweeks of development. Fetal breathing movements involve muscle contractions that cause the inhalation of\\namniotic fluid and exhalation of the same fluid, with pulmonary surfactant and mucus. Fetal breathing movements\\nare not continuous and may include periods of frequent movements and periods of no movements. Maternal factors\\ncan influence the frequency of breathing movements. For example, high blood glucose levels, called hyperglycemia,\\ncan boost the number of breathing movements. Conversely, low blood glucose levels, called hypoglycemia, can\\nreduce the number of fetal breathing movements. Tobacco use is also known to lower fetal breathing rates. Fetal\\nbreathing may help tone the muscles in preparation for breathing movements once the fetus is born. It may also\\nhelp the alveoli to form and mature. Fetal breathing movements are considered a sign of robust health.\\n984 22 • The Respiratory System\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'),\n",
